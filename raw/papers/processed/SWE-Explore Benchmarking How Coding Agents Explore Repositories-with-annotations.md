Abstract

Repository-level coding benchmarks such as SWE-bench have driven a rapid
surge in the capabilities of coding agents. Yet they usually treat coding tasks as
a holistic, binary prediction problem (e.g., resolved or unresolved), neglecting
fine-grained agent capabilities such as repository understanding, context retrieval,
code localization, and bug diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Explore, a
benchmark that isolates the evaluation of repository exploration, a critical capability
of coding agents. Given a repository and an issue, SWE-Explore asks an explorer
to return a ranked list of relevant code regions under a fixed line budget. SWE-
Explore covers 848 issues across 10 programming languages and 203 open-source
repositories. For each instance, we derive line-level ground truth from independent
agent trajectories that successfully solved the same issue, distilling the specific
code regions their solution paths actually consulted. We evaluate exploration along
coverage, ranking, and context-efficiency dimensions, showing that these metrics
strongly track downstream repair behavior. Across a broad set of retrieval methods,
general coding agents, and specialized localizers, we find that agentic explorers
form a clear tier above classical retrieval. While file-level localization is already
strong for modern methods, line-level coverage and efficient ranking remain the
key axes differentiating state-of-the-art explorers.

Introduction

Repository-level coding benchmarks, such as SWE-bench [11], have driven a rapid surge in the
capabilities of automated coding agents [6, 7, 33]. The ecosystem around these benchmarks has
expanded quickly: new evaluation distributions now cover multilingual repositories, multimodal
software issues, and harder, long-horizon professional tasks [2, 29, 30, 32]. In parallel, scalable
training-oriented resources like SWE-smith [30], SWE-Gym [15], and SWE-Dev [23] are actively
fueling agent development.Supported by these robust resources, frameworks such as SWE-agent [28],
AutoCodeRover [34], Agentless [27], OpenHands [24], Claude Code [1], Mini-SWE-Agent [28], and
AweAgent [3] have successfully turned repository-scale issue resolution into a practical, everyday
testbed for software engineering agents.

However, the widespread adoption of these benchmarks stems from a protocol that is both their
strength and primary limitation: each repair attempt is reduced to a single pass/fail prediction, as

localization, and patch synthesis. SWE-Explore isolates repository exploration as a line-level
evaluation target.

shown in Figure 1. While this binary metric makes models directly comparable, it obscures the
underlying mechanics of success. A holistic pass/fail score cannot reveal which specific step—reading
the relevant code, localizing the bug, generating the patch, or validating the fix—actually succeeded
or failed. Once we step back from this single prediction, two distinct failure modes emerge. An
agent either fails to explore the relevant code for the fix, or it retrieves sufficient evidence but fails to
synthesize a correct patch. While the latter is readily captured by existing executable benchmarks,
the former is largely hidden. A real-world repository contains thousands of files. Determining which
specific lines carries the evidence for a given issue is a daunting challenge, even for the agents
that ultimately solve it. This decomposition is increasingly recognized by recent work on context
management and bug localization [5, 13, 22, 26, 31, 37].

Consequently, the capability of coding agents in repository exploration remains under-measured.
Despite recent efforts to study agentic localization and retrieval [5, 13, 22, 26, 31, 35, 37], existing
evaluations still lack a common, precise target for comparing classical retrievers, search agents, and
long-context selectors. Measuring file or function level localization only indicates whether an agent
reached the right general neighborhood, no metric reveals exactly which lines of code were explored.
Without visibility into line-level coverage, we cannot rigorously evaluate how well an agent explores
a repository before it begins to write code.

In this paper, we introduce SWE-Explore, a benchmark that turns repository exploration into a
comparable evaluation target. Given an issue and a repository, an explorer is asked to return a ranked
list of code regions; we then score that list against ground truth derived from independent agent
trajectories that successfully solved the same issue, asking how early it surfaces the evidence those
trajectories actually relied on. The output format is deliberately simple: sparse retrievers, interactive
agents, and long-context selectors are all compared as producers of the same ranked region list under
a fixed line budget. This lets SWE-Explore evaluate exploration behavior without requiring the
explorer to write or validate a patch.

To check that a higher exploration score actually leads to better repair, SWE-Explore is paired with
a controlled downstream protocol: we feed each explorer’s output—and only that output—as the
available repository context to a fixed coding agent, and measure whether the resulting patch passes
the original test suite. This protocol is not a replacement for the primary benchmark but a way to
verify that what our exploration metrics measure is the same thing that drives downstream success. In
this sense, the downstream protocol serves as an external validity check, while the benchmark itself
remains a lightweight context-selection task.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:

• A new evaluation target. We isolate repository exploration from end-to-end repair and formalize
it as a ranked, line-level context selection task, so that retrievers, search agents, and long-context
selectors can be compared on the axis they are designed to improve.

• Trajectory-grounded supervision. We propose a novel method to annotate ground truth lines

from successful agent trajectories, with least requiring manual annotation.

• A studied metric set, validated against repair. We systematically compare coverage, ranking,
and budget-efficiency metrics, and use a controlled downstream protocol—where each explorer’s
output is the only context visible to a fixed coding agent—to show that the metrics we keep are
predictive of repair success across a broad set of explorers.

2 Related Work

2.1 Coding Benchmarks

Repository-level benchmarks have established executable issue resolution as the central evalua-
tion target for coding agents. SWE-bench couples issue descriptions, repository snapshots, and
harness-based verification [11], with Verified [6] and Live [33] variants tightening quality and con-
tamination control. Subsequent work broadens the scope along several axes: multilingual coverage
(SWE-bench Multilingual[30], Multi-SWE-bench[32]), multi-turn and rebased settings (SWE-bench
Multimodal[29], SWE-rebench[2]). A second line of work pushes evaluation toward intermediate be-
havior: ContextBench [13] introduces human-annotated gold contexts and scores retrieval over agent
trajectories [13], while SWE-Pruner [26] and SWE-ContextBench [37] respectively benchmark con-
text compression and experience reuse. Related efforts also examine adjacent repository-level abilities,
including hierarchical debugging and correctness checking, programmer behavior patterns, multi-
agent debate, experience-driven repair, and repository-level question answering [4, 12, 16, 19, 21].

These benchmarks either target the full issue-to-patch pipeline or evaluate isolated facets of inter-
mediate behavior; what is missing is a single benchmark in which trajectory-grounded, line-level
exploration quality and its downstream effect on issue resolution can be measured jointly, as shown
in Table 1. This matters because exploration quality is not fully captured by either coarse context
labels or final resolve rate: an explorer may reach the right file but miss the decisive span, or surface
the right evidence too late in a ranked output. SWE-Explore is complementary rather than competing:
it derives line-level supervision directly from successful agent trajectories, evaluates exploration as a
ranked region-list task, and pairs the exploration score with a restricted-context executable validation
on the same instances.

2.2 Explorer Methods

Localization and explorer methods study how relevant code is found inside a repository. Classical
retrieval and bug-localization work ranks code artifacts from natural-language reports, with TF–
IDF [18] and BM25 [17] as lightweight baselines and IR-based bug localization targeting likely faulty
files [36]. Semantic code search and repository retrieval broaden this setting to natural-language-
to-function search and cross-file code completion [8, 14], while nDCG [9] provides a standard way
to reward useful evidence appearing early in a ranked list. Long-context compression work further
highlights that selecting, compressing, and preserving code context are themselves central design

choices for code models and agents [20, 25]. These evaluations supply useful methodology, but their
targets are usually query–snippet relevance, next-line completion relevance, or bug-file relevance
rather than the line regions consulted during successful issue resolution.

Recent LLM-based methods move from static retrieval toward interactive exploration. Au-
toCodeRover combines LLM reasoning, code search, and program analysis [34]; LocAgent [5],
OrcaLoca [31], and CoSIL [10] evaluate localization over files, functions, ranked entities, or iterative
code-graph search; and CodeScout studies pre-exploration for problem-statement improvement [22].
General-purpose coding agents further show that navigation, context management, tool use, and patch
generation are tightly coupled in practical repair [1, 3, 24, 27, 28]. What remains less systematic is a
common target for comparing lexical retrievers, dense retrievers, rerankers, and agentic explorers as
ranked, line-level region producers. SWE-Explore fills this gap with trajectory-grounded line-level
targets and a fixed-scaffold downstream protocol in which only the selected context varies.

3 SWE-Explore Benchmark

3.1 Task Formulation

SWE-Explore formulates repository exploration as a standalone functionality. Given an issue q and a
repository snapshot R, SWE-Explore returns a ranked list of relevant code regions:

f : (q, R) (cid:55)→ P = (r1, r2, . . . , rK),

where P = (r1, r2, . . . , rK) is the ranked region list. Each region ri = (pi, si, ei) consists of a file
path pi and a line range [si, ei]. SWE-Explore does not require a final patch, does not access the
ground truth, and is not required to interact with the repository. As shown in Figure 2, the benchmark
scores P against trajectory-grounded supervision derived per instance (§3.3) using the metric family
in §3.4. Independently, we use a restricted-context repair bridge (§3.4) as a one-time methodological
validation that these metrics track repair behavior; the bridge is not part of the standard evaluation
loop, and a new explorer can be benchmarked using only the metrics above.

3.2 Data Sources

SWE-Explore is built on three public repository-level data sources: SWE-bench Verified [6, 11], SWE-
bench-Pro [7], and SWE-bench Multilingual [30]. After the solution-verification filter described in
§3.3, we retain 848 instances spanning 10 programming languages and 203 open-source repositories.

non-test source code. Per-source breakdowns and the full benchmark distribution are deferred to
Appendix A.

3.3 Ground-Truth Annotation

SWE-Explore keeps only instances for which we observe at least two successful issue-resolution
trajectories from strong LLMs such as GPT-5.4, Gemini-3-Pro, Sonnet-4.6, GLM-5.1, and Kimi-K2.6.
Instances without two successful trajectories are excluded, because their trajectory-derived context
would not support the cross-run agreement signal used below. After this filter, 848 instances are
retained across the three source datasets.

Trajectory Source. Directly annotating necessary context by hand is costly at our scale and difficult
to make consistent: hundreds of repository-level issues span ten languages, and annotators may
draw different boundaries around helpers, configuration, and tests. SWE-Explore instead derives
supervision from solution-verified agent trajectories: successful runs by strong coding agents such as
GPT-5.4, Gemini-3-Pro, Sonnet-4.6, GLM-5.1, and Kimi-2.6 under the original harness. For each
retained instance, we collect its successful trajectory set T with |T | ≥ 2.

We treat regions repeatedly surfaced across independent successful trajectories as a behavioral signal
for core context: they are the code spans that different solution paths naturally explored while
resolving the same issue. Given T , we first intersect read regions across trajectories to obtain
conservative core candidates, then use an LLM-based refinement step to promote a small subset of
model-specific optional reads when they are load-bearing for the issue. Finally, the authors manually
audit every refined ground truth against the issue and trajectories, removing unsupported regions.

Extracting reads. From each trajectory we collect all read actions that resolve to an explicit file–
interval pair—editor-style view tool calls, command-line reads (cat/head/tail/sed -n), and grep
-n line hits within R—and normalize them into regions (p, s, e). Actions we cannot unambiguously
map to such a pair (e.g., free-form terminal interaction) are discarded rather than heuristically
expanded, keeping the supervision record strictly grounded in observable reads.

Generating regions. Let R(τ ) be the set of (p, s, e) regions extracted from trajectory τ as described
above. We first compute a conservative intersection candidate Rint = (cid:84)
τ ∈T R(τ ) and collect model-
R(τ )(cid:1) \ Rint, where Tm ⊆ T
specific optional reads outside this intersection as R(m)
is the successful trajectories from model family m. Intersection and union are taken file-wise at
the line level, so two overlapping reads of parser.py:40–80 and parser.py:60–100 contribute
parser.py:60–80 to Rint.
The final ground-truth core Rcore used in this paper is the refined version of Rint: an LLM-based
refinement step promotes a small subset of optional reads when they are load-bearing for the issue,
and the authors then manually audit the resulting regions. Unless otherwise stated, all later uses of

3.4 Metrics

With ground truth in hand, the next question is how to score an explorer’s ranked region list against
it. Let L(r) ⊆ {(p, ℓ)} be the set of (p, ℓ) pairs covered by region r, and for budget B let P≤B be
the longest prefix of P whose cumulative |L(·)| does not exceed B. Write L(P ) = (cid:83)
i L(ri) and
Y = L(Rcore).

Coverage and accuracy. Precision and recall are defined at the line level, PREC = |L(P ) ∩
Y |/|L(P )| and REC = |L(P ) ∩ Y |/|Y |, with F1 their harmonic mean. We also report two coarser
hit rates that capture the practically important event of overlapping the right code even when line
spans are imprecise: a file-level HITFILE = |{p : ∃i, pi = p} ∩ FILES(Y )|/|FILES(Y )|, and a
region-level analogue HITREGION = |{r ∈ Rcore : ∃i, L(ri) ∩ L(r) ̸= ∅}|/|Rcore|, which counts
the fraction of core regions for which the explorer surfaced at least one overlapping prediction.

Ranking under budget. We adapt nDCG to a line-budget setting. Each predicted region ri is
assigned a gain gi equal to the number of core lines it covers; regions are processed in their predicted
order, and DCG@B accumulates the discounted gain over the longest prefix whose cumulative line
count stays within the budget B:

DCG@B =

(cid:88)

i∈P≤B

gi
log2(i + 2)

.

NDCG@B normalizes this against the best DCG attainable on the same instance under the same
line budget; the ideal-ordering procedure is described in Appendix C. Using a line budget instead
of a rank cutoff means a single verbose region that exhausts the budget without proportional gain is
penalized just as heavily as omitting useful content. We additionally report first useful hit (FUH),
defined as 1 − i⋆/|P | where i⋆ is the smallest rank whose visible lines intersect the core target Y
(and 0 if no rank in P does); higher FUH means the explorer surfaced useful evidence earlier.

Efficiency and noise. Context efficiency is the fraction of predicted visible lines that fall inside
L(Rcore) ∪ L(R(m)
opt ), quantifying how much of the selected context is grounded evidence versus
off-target. A complementary noise rate, defined as the fraction of predicted regions overlapping
neither Rcore nor R(m)

opt , serves as a region-level diagnostic.

Validation by downstream repair. To check that the metrics above track downstream repair
behavior, we construct a one-time restricted-context environment: for a given explorer output P , we
hide everything in the repository outside (cid:83)
i(pi, [si, ei]), and ask a fixed coding agent to produce a
patch that is then judged by the original SWE-bench harness. This is a one-time sanity check on the
metrics and is not part of the standard evaluation procedure, and §4.2 uses it to quantify how well
each metric predicts resolve rate; full implementation details—the sanitized container, the line-budget
value B, the test-callback interface, and the patch scaffold—are given in Appendix D.

4 Experiments

4.1 Setup

Explorers. We evaluate explorers from four families. Two baselines bound the dynamic range:
Oracle returns Rcore directly, and Random returns uniformly sampled regions. Sparse retrievers are
represented by BM25 [17] and TF–IDF [18]. As a lightweight dense retriever we use a RAG pipeline
instantiated with Potion, a static word-embedding retriever distilled from a sentence transformer.
Finally, the agentic explorers cover five general-purpose coding agents (Claude Code [1], Codex,
OpenHands [24], Mini-SWE-Agent [28], AweAgent [3]) and four published academic localization
agents (AutoCodeRover [34], LocAgent [5], OrcaLoca [31], CoSIL [10]); Oracle in particular plays
a central role in validating our ground-truth construction (§4.2).

Metrics. Following the analysis in §3.4, we report a combination of strongly predictive metrics
and standard baselines. The primary metrics are Precision, nDCG@500, HitFile, and Context
Efficiency, selected for their high correlation with downstream behavior and low mutual redundancy.
We additionally report Recall, F1, and hit/noise region rates as conventional references, even though
several of these exhibit weaker predictive power individually. Full metric definitions are in §3.4.

Choice of K. On our refined ground truth, the per-instance number of core regions averages roughly
4.7 after the LLM-refinement step (§3.3). We therefore fix K=5 for every explorer in this paper:
each explorer is asked to return its five most relevant regions, which keeps the comparison both fair
across systems and aligned with the size of the supervision target.

4.2 Downstream validation.

Before using upstream exploration metrics as the main evaluation target, we ask whether they track
downstream repair behavior. On a shared n=150 subset of SWE-Explore Bench, each explorer

provides its K=5 ranked regions; the resulting context is then given to a fixed Mini-SWE-Agent
patcher backed by GPT-5.4 and Gemini-3-Pro, and we average the SWE-bench harness resolve rate
over the two patchers. Table 4 reports the explorer-level Pearson and Spearman correlations between
each upstream metric and this downstream resolve rate.

Stable signals. The strongest metrics are not purely file-level or purely recall-based. Context
Efficiency has the highest Pearson correlation (r=0.950), suggesting that useful context must be both
relevant and compact. Rec@100 is the strongest rank-correlated signal (ρ=0.845), indicating that
early coverage under a tight line budget is especially predictive of repair. HitFile, HitRegion, and
FUH remain strong Pearson signals: they capture whether the explorer reaches the right file, overlaps
the right evidence, and surfaces useful evidence early. Precision is also predictive, but it is most
informative when interpreted together with coverage-oriented metrics.

Useful but incomplete signals. Rank-aware metrics such as nDCG@500 have very high Pearson
correlation but weaker Spearman correlation, indicating that they separate broad quality tiers well but
are less stable for ordering nearby explorers. Recall-style metrics show a budget effect: Rec@100 is
strong in both views, while broader recall metrics and F1 are more rank-sensitive than scale-sensitive,
reflecting their tendency to reward broad reading even when the selected context is not compact.
Noise rates have the expected negative correlation, but serve better as diagnostics than as standalone
success measures. Together, these results justify reporting a mixed metric set rather than a single
score. In Table 6 and Table 5, we therefore emphasize HitRegion, HitFile, Precision, nDCG@500,
FUH, and Context Efficiency, while retaining Recall, F1, Recall@500, and noise-region rate as
complementary diagnostics.

4.3 Exploration Quality

Table 5 and Table 6 report upstream exploration quality for all explorers and models at K=5. We
highlight the following observations.

Agentic exploration is a clear step above non-agentic retrieval. Sparse retrievers (BM25, TF–
IDF) and the lightweight dense retriever remain close to Random on most metrics, while every
agentic explorer is substantially higher than them. This confirms that repository exploration is
not well captured by one-shot lexical or embedding retrieval alone: multi-step interaction with the
repository is already necessary to reach the metric range occupied by modern coding agents.

Low F1 is mostly a recall problem. Despite strong file-level hit rates and ranking scores, most
non-oracle explorers still have low F1, and the limiting term is usually line-level recall rather than
precision. The general-purpose coding agents all reach high HitFile and nDCG@500, but their Recℓ
remains only around 0.14–0.19; AutoCodeRover is highly precise, yet also recall-limited. This
suggests that broad enough repository exploration remains a central bottleneck for current code-agent-
style explorers: they often find plausible files early, but miss many of the specific spans needed to
cover the full ground-truth context.

LLM choice shifts the operating point, but not the bottleneck. Table 5 controls the scaffold by
running the same Mini-SWE-Agent explorer with different LLMs. The GPT-family models form
the strongest tier, but with slightly different profiles: GPT-5.4 is cleaner and more compact, while
GPT-5.4-mini surfaces more core regions and ranks useful evidence earlier. Kimi-K2.6 and Sonnet-
4.5 form a middle tier, and GLM-4.7 and Gemini-3-Pro lag mainly in coverage and ranking. The
larger pattern is more important than the exact ordering: across all LLMs, file-level hits remain much
stronger than line-level recall, so replacing the base model alone does not remove the exploration
bottleneck. High-recall region discovery still appears to require better exploration mechanisms, not
just a stronger patching model.

General coding agents behave surprisingly similarly. Claude Code, Codex, OpenHands, Mini-
SWE-Agent, and AweAgent have closely matched profiles across coverage, ranking, and efficiency
metrics. This is notable because they differ in implementation and harness complexity, yet their
exploration outputs occupy nearly the same operating point: high file hit, high early ranking, compact
context, and low line recall. The similarity suggests that a complex repair harness is not necessarily
required to study the exploration subproblem; a simpler explorer interface can expose much of the
same behavior.

Specialized localizers only help when they broaden search. The academic agents do not uni-
formly dominate general coding agents. AutoCodeRover is precise but conservative, OrcaLoca has
very low noise but misses many relevant regions, and LocAgent resembles the general-agent profile
rather than changing the recall frontier. CoSIL is the main exception: it achieves by far the highest
non-oracle Recℓ and F1, suggesting that its iterative code-graph search is an important component
for high-recall exploration. In contrast, explorers that rely more heavily on shell-style navigation or
narrow search actions may reach the right files while still under-covering line-level evidence.

Line-level evaluation adds information beyond file hits. HitFile remains a strong and useful
signal, as shown by the downstream correlations in §4.2; however, it does not distinguish whether an
explorer actually surfaces the relevant spans inside those files. The contrast between high HitFile and
much lower Recℓ across most agentic explorers supports SWE-Explore’s line-level design: file-level
localization captures reaching the right neighborhood, while line-level metrics measure whether the
evidence needed by successful trajectories is actually exposed.

4.4 Controlled Context Degradation

The previous sections show that explorer behavior differs along coverage, precision, ranking, and
efficiency, and that these differences affect downstream repair. Here we ask a more controlled
robustness question: is a patcher more sensitive to missing relevant context or to redundant irrelevant
context? In the restricted-context validation environment (§3.4), we synthetically perturb Oracle
context by exposing only an α ∈ {0, 25, 50, 75, 100} fraction of core regions (missing-context

9

Figure 5: Resolve rate as the visible context degrades from the Oracle’s full core set Rcore to either
α% of Rcore alone (GT scaling, solid) or α% of Rcore padded back to full size with random non-core
regions (noise injection, dashed).

condition), or by filling the removed budget with randomly sampled non-core regions (redundant-
context condition). We sweep α on two stratified n=150 subsets of SWE-Explore under both a weak
patcher GPT-5.4-mini and a strong patcher GPT-5.4; Figure 5 reports all four panels.
Missing context is the dominant failure mode. On the easier subset, downstream resolve rate
changes sharply only after enough core evidence is present: performance stays low through partial
context, then jumps between α=50 and α=75. This threshold-like pattern suggests that patchers
are not simply accumulating value smoothly from every additional region; instead, several pieces
of core evidence must be present together before a correct fix becomes likely. Redundant context
is less damaging once this threshold is crossed: the redundant-context curve closely tracks the
missing-context curve for α ≥ 75, indicating that modern patchers can tolerate extra irrelevant
code when the essential evidence is already visible. This agrees with the metric analysis above:
in the high-coverage regime, missing core evidence matters more than moderate precision loss, so
recall-oriented improvements are more valuable than small filtering gains. Redundancy hurts most
when core evidence is scarce, especially at α=0, where random non-core code lowers resolve rate
by 7–9 pp. The harder subset shows a much narrower range, suggesting that when the issue itself
exceeds the patcher’s capability, improving context alone has limited effect.
The easier-subset dip suggests caution with empty-context baselines. Both easier-subset curves
dip from α=0 to α=25, especially under the stronger patcher. A plausible explanation is memoriza-
tion: with no repository context, the model may rely on an issue-only prior, while a small incomplete
slice of Rcore pushes it to reconcile partial evidence. Because the dip disappears on the harder subset,
we treat it as a caveat rather than the main effect: empty-context baselines on canonical repositories
may be inflated and should be interpreted carefully.

5 Conclusion

We presented SWE-Explore, a benchmark for evaluating repository exploration independently from
patch generation through ranked, line-level context selection. Using trajectory-derived supervision,
SWE-Explore compares retrievers, search agents, and long-context selectors by the evidence they
surface rather than only by final repair outcomes. Our experiments show that exploration metrics track
downstream repair, that current agents are strong at finding relevant files but remain recall-limited at
the line level, and that missing core evidence hurts more than moderate redundant context. We hope
SWE-Explore provides a focused target for building explorers that read repositories more broadly
and expose the spans repair agents actually need.

A Dataset Details

This appendix supplements §3.2. The main paper reports the aggregate benchmark statistics; here
we specify the retained instance set, record schema, and repository-snapshot assumptions used by
SWE-Explore.

Source benchmarks and filtering. SWE-Explore is constructed from three public repository-level
sources: SWE-bench Verified, SWE-bench-Pro, and SWE-bench Multilingual. We keep an instance
only when at least two trajectory resolves the original task under the source benchmark’s executable
harness. This filtering step ensures that the supervision target is extracted from successful repair
behavior rather than from failed exploration attempts. After filtering, SWE-Explore contains 848
instances across 10 programming languages and 203 open-source repositories.

Benchmark composition. The retained set combines Python-centered verified issues, harder
professional software-engineering tasks, and multilingual issue-resolution tasks. This design keeps
the benchmark tied to executable repair while reducing dependence on a single language ecosystem
or repository family.

Language distribution. The language distribution is shown in Table 7. Python remains the largest
subset because SWE-bench Verified is Python-centric; SWE-bench-Pro and SWE-bench Multilingual
add most of the non-Python coverage.

Benchmark record schema. Each instance is stored as a structured record containing the issue,
repository metadata, trajectory provenance, and line-level supervision. The core fields are:

• instance_id: unique instance identifier;
• repo: source repository name;
• source: source benchmark;
• problem_statement: natural-language issue description;
• ground_truth.read_core_regions: line-level core regions used for scoring;
• ground_truth.read_optional_regions: optional regions used for diagnostics and

context-efficiency computation;

• provenance: successful source trajectories and extraction metadata.

All file paths are stored as repository-relative paths. Line intervals are 1-indexed and closed. Before
scoring, paths are canonicalized so that equivalent spellings such as ./src/foo.py and src/foo.py
map to the same repository-relative file.

Repository snapshots. Each instance is evaluated against a fixed repository snapshot inherited
from its source benchmark. The same snapshot is used to resolve line intervals, score explorer
predictions, and run restricted-context downstream validation. Generated files, temporary files,
external dependency paths, and files outside the repository checkout are not treated as valid repository
files.

B Ground-Truth Construction and Refinement Details

This appendix supplements §3.3. The main paper describes the trajectory-grounded construction at a
high level; here we record the extraction, normalization, refinement, and audit rules used to produce
the final line-level targets.

Read extraction. We extract observable file-reading behavior and convert it into repository-relative
line regions. We parse three types of read signals:

• Editor views: tool calls with an explicit file path and visible line range;

• Command-line reads: commands such as cat, head, tail, and sed -n when the target

file can be resolved;

• Search hits: grep -n outputs that can be mapped to repository files and line numbers.

Signals that cannot be mapped to a unique file–interval pair are discarded. This rule keeps the
supervision tied to observable repository reads and avoids expanding ambiguous terminal output into
unsupported line regions.

Path normalization. Absolute paths are accepted only when they point inside the repository
checkout. Relative paths are normalized by removing redundant ./ segments, resolving .. segments
whenever possible, and matching the result against the repository file index. Reads mapped to
multiple candidate files are discarded. Reads mapped outside the repository are also discarded.

Line-interval normalization. Each read is converted into a tuple (p, s, e), where p is the repository-
relative path and [s, e] is a 1-indexed closed interval. Whole-file reads are expanded using the file’s
line count at the evaluated checkout. Out-of-range intervals are clipped to valid file boundaries.
Empty intervals are removed. Adjacent or overlapping intervals from the same trajectory and file are
merged before cross-trajectory aggregation.

14

Core and optional context. Let T be the successful trajectory set for an instance and let R(τ )
denote the merged line regions read by trajectory τ . The raw core context is the file-wise, line-level
intersection across successful trajectories:

Rraw

core =

(cid:92)

τ ∈T

R(τ ).

The raw optional context is the portion of successful reads outside this intersection:

Rraw

opt =

(cid:33)

R(τ )

\ Rraw
core.

(cid:32)

(cid:91)

τ ∈T

The union has high recall but includes exploratory detours, redundant file openings, and model-
specific context that may not be necessary for repair. The intersection is more conservative: it keeps
only evidence consulted across successful solution paths. SWE-Explore therefore uses the refined
core as the main scoring target and keeps optional context for diagnostics and context-efficiency
computation.

LLM-assisted refinement. Pure intersection can under-cover cases where different successful
agents use different but equivalent evidence. We therefore consider optional regions that are repeatedly
visited, directly adjacent to core evidence, or close to modified regions. For each candidate, the
refinement model receives the issue statement, the candidate region, nearby code context, and a
compact summary of successful trajectories. The output schema contains:

• a binary decision on whether the candidate is load-bearing;

• a short rationale grounded in the issue and trajectory evidence;

• the precise line interval to promote into the refined core.

Candidates without a precise promoted interval are rejected.

Human audit. Every promoted region is manually audited against the issue, source trajectories,
and final patch. The audit checks whether:

• the region exists in the repository at the evaluated checkout;

• the region is relevant to the issue rather than merely adjacent or frequently opened;

• including it rewards evidence that a successful solution plausibly relied on.

Regions that fail any check are removed. The audit keeps the target conservative while recovering
load-bearing context that pure intersection may miss.

Context variants. For analysis, we maintain three target variants: pure intersection, refined core,
and full union. The pure-intersection target is maximally conservative. The full-union target is
high-recall but noisy. The refined-core target balances these two extremes and is the default target
used in the main experiments.

C Metric Definitions and Ideal-Order Implementation

This appendix supplements §3.4. The main paper defines the metric family used in the experiments;
here we give the evaluator-level definitions, including duplicate handling, budgeted prefixes, and the
ideal-order computation used by nDCG.

Line universe. All metrics are computed over repository-relative line identifiers (p, ℓ), where p is a
normalized path and ℓ is a 1-indexed line number. A predicted region contributes all visible lines
in its clipped interval. Duplicate predicted lines are counted once for set-based precision and recall,
while the original region order is preserved for rank-aware metrics.
Let L(r) denote the set of line identifiers covered by region r, let L(P ) = (cid:83)
of predicted lines, and let Y = L(Rcore) denote the line-level core target.

i L(ri) denote the union

15

Coverage metrics. Line-level precision and recall are defined as:

Prec =

|L(P ) ∩ Y |
|L(P )|

,

Recℓ =

|L(P ) ∩ Y |
|Y |

.

F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:

F1 =

2 · Prec · Recℓ
Prec + Recℓ

.

Hit rates. We also report two coarser hit rates. HITFILE measures whether the prediction reaches
ground-truth files:

HitFile =

|{p : ∃i, pi = p} ∩ Files(Y )|
|Files(Y )|

.

HITREGION measures whether each ground-truth region is overlapped by at least one predicted
region:

HitRegion =

|{r ∈ Rcore : ∃i, L(ri) ∩ L(r) ̸= ∅}|
|Rcore|

.

Budgeted prefixes. For a line budget B, P≤B is the longest prediction prefix whose cumulative
visible lines do not exceed B. This prefix definition penalizes explorers that place very large
regions early: a verbose early region can exhaust the budget before more useful evidence appears.
The main experiments use B = 500 for the primary rank-aware score and additionally compute
B ∈ {100, 300, 500} in the released evaluator.

nDCG. For nDCG, each predicted region receives gain equal to the number of newly covered core
lines. Regions are processed in predicted order, and the discounted gain is:

The normalized score is:

DCG@B =

(cid:88)

i∈P≤B

gi
log2(i + 2)

.

nDCG@B =

DCG@B
IDCG@B

.

Ideal-ordering for nDCG. The ideal DCG is computed under the same line budget as the explorer
output. We construct the ideal order greedily: at each step, the evaluator selects the remaining ground-
truth region with the largest marginal uncovered-line gain, subject to the remaining line budget.
Ties are broken by shorter region length and then by repository path. This makes the normalization
instance-specific and budget-matched: an explorer is compared against the best achievable ordering
of the same target evidence, not against an unconstrained full-context oracle.

First useful hit. First Useful Hit (FUH) measures how early the explorer first surfaces any core
evidence. Let i⋆ be the first predicted rank whose visible lines intersect Y . We define:

FUH =

(cid:26)1 − i⋆/|P |, when such i⋆ exists,

0,

otherwise.

Higher values indicate that useful evidence appears earlier in the ranked list.

Efficiency and noise. Context efficiency is the fraction of predicted visible lines that fall inside
either core or optional context:

CtxEff =

|L(P ) ∩ (L(Rcore) ∪ L(Ropt))|
|L(P )|

.

Noise rate is the fraction of predicted regions that overlap neither core nor optional context. The main
table reports region-level noise.

Aggregation. Metrics are computed per instance and then averaged over instances. Empty predic-
tions receive zero for coverage, ranking, first-hit, and efficiency metrics. Predictions with invalid
paths or empty intervals are discarded before scoring.

D Restricted-Context Validation Protocol

This appendix supplements §3.4 and §4.2. The restricted-context protocol is used to test whether the
selected regions can support actual patch generation under a fixed patching scaffold; it is not part of
the standard upstream scoring loop.

Context materialization. For each explorer output, we first normalize paths, clip intervals to file
boundaries, and remove invalid regions. For selected files, only the predicted line intervals remain
visible. Lines outside the selected intervals are replaced with blank placeholders rather than deleted,
so that repository paths and line numbers remain stable during patch generation and debugging. Files
not selected by the explorer are hidden from the patching agent.

Fixed patch scaffold. All restricted-context runs use the same patcher, prompt template, tool set,
and interaction budget. The only variable is the visible context produced by the explorer. This control
is important because otherwise a higher resolve rate could reflect a stronger patch-generation scaffold
rather than better exploration.

Patch application and harness evaluation. After patch generation, the predicted diff is applied to
the original repository checkout and evaluated with the source benchmark’s executable harness. An
instance is counted as resolved only when the patch passes the benchmark’s standard tests. Empty
patches, unparsable diffs, failed patch applications, and test failures are all counted as unresolved.

Failure diagnostics. For every unresolved run, we log a coarse failure reason: no diff generated,
invalid diff, patch failed to apply, patch outside visible context, applied patch failed tests, timeout, or
infrastructure error. These diagnostics do not change the resolved/unresolved label; they are used to
understand how restricted context affects repair.

E Explorer Implementation Details

This appendix supplements the explorer setup in §4.3. All methods are converted to the same output
contract before scoring: an ordered list of at most K = 5 repository-relative line regions. Each region
is represented as a path and a closed line interval. Invalid paths, empty intervals, and regions outside
the repository checkout are discarded before evaluation.

Retrieval baselines. BM25 and TF–IDF use the issue statement as the query and rank repository
chunks by lexical similarity. The top-ranked chunks are converted into line regions. Potion uses the
same chunk-and-rank interface as a lightweight dense retrieval baseline.

Agentic explorers. For agentic explorers, each system is run under its original search or localization
scaffold. We then normalize the resulting file, function, or region outputs into line-level regions.
When a method produces file-level outputs, we map them to the most specific span supported by the
method output or associated read trace. This conversion is applied before scoring so that all methods
are compared under the same ranked-region contract.

Output validation. Before scoring, each prediction is checked for path validity, interval validity,
and repository membership. Invalid predictions are dropped. Predictions with empty intervals are
dropped. The remaining predictions are scored according to their original order.

F Case Study: scikit-learn/scikit-learn#10844

To make the quantitative results in §4.3 concrete, we walk through a single instance for which all 14
explorers produced output and whose ground truth is small enough to inspect end-to-end. We pick a
real numerical-overflow bug whose ranking on this single instance closely tracks the ordering in the
main tables, so the case mirrors — rather than distorts — the global picture.

Issue (scikit-learn/scikit-learn#10844, from SWE-Bench Verified). The issue is titled
“fowlkes_mallows_score returns RuntimeWarning when variables get too big.” The reporter
observes that the line

return tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk) if tk != 0.

else 0.

inside sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py silently overflows when pk * qk exceeds
232, because pk and qk are 32-bit integers; the result is a RuntimeWarning and a corrupted score.
The fix casts the operands to np.float64 before the multiplication, plus adds a regression test in
tests/test_supervised.py that triggers the overflow path.

Ground truth. The refined ground truth lists two core files spanning only 26 lines in total, so the
line-recall view is not dominated by wide whole-file scopes:

Discussion. Three patterns are visible, and all three echo the global ordering reported in §4.3.

First, one-shot lexical retrieval is essentially useless on this bug. TF–IDF, Potion, and Random all
reach HitFile = 0. The issue text contains no rare identifier that pins down the modified module: it

18

talks about RuntimeWarning, overflow, and integer multiplication, all of which are far more frequent
in the project’s templates and documentation than in the implementation. BM25 partially recovers
(HitFile = 0.50) by anchoring on fowlkes_mallows_score appearing both in the title and in the
file, but it still buries the function below four template files and never reaches the regression test.
This is the regime the global numbers describe: sparse retrievers cluster near Random on file hit, and
Potion adds little above them.

Second, the academic localizers behave like the rest of the paper: precise on the implemen-
tation file, blind to the test file. AutoCodeRover, OrcaLoca, LocAgent, and CoSIL all reach
supervised.py and land squarely on the fowlkes_mallows_score block, but none of them
surfaces test_supervised.py; their HitFile therefore caps at 0.50. AutoCodeRover and OrcaLoca
additionally under-fill the top-5 budget, emitting only one region, which costs them line recall and
coverage even within the file they do reach. CoSIL again emits whole files, which lifts Recℓ to 0.81
at the cost of high file-level noise — the same Recℓ/HitFile asymmetry it shows in the main table.

Third, all five general-purpose agents converge on the same fix neighborhood. Claude Code, Mini-
SWE-Agent, AweAgent, Codex, and OpenHands all reach both ground-truth files (HitFile = 1.00),
and all land on the fowlkes_mallows_score body in supervised.py:787–859 plus the sur-
rounding test block in test_supervised.py:239–276. Differences between them reduce to small
variations in span shape and how many auxiliary regions they include: Codex emits the tightest
spans on the fix line itself (852–859), while AweAgent and OpenHands include extra context such as
imports or related metrics. This mirrors the main-table observation that the general agents form a
tight cluster on HitFile and Cov, with the remaining variance dominated by how much surrounding
code each one chooses to return.

Takeaway. On this instance the practical ranking is Random/TF–IDF/Potion ≪ BM25 < academic
localizers (one file only, precise) < general agents (both files, function-scoped spans) < CoSIL
(recall by whole-file emission) < Oracle. The relative ordering and the magnitude of the gaps both
match the global tables: the lexical baselines sit at the floor, the academic localizers occupy a narrow
precision-leaning band, the general agents share a higher operating point on file hit and coverage, and
only Oracle achieves matching scores on both line-level and file-level metrics. The case therefore
illustrates why we report file hit, line recall, and coverage together: each metric independently
reproduces a different part of this same ordering.

G Reproducibility, Compute, and Limitations

This appendix collects implementation information that is not central to the main argument but is
needed to interpret the released artifact and compute cost.

Reproducibility. The released artifact contains benchmark records, the common explorer-output
schema, metric computation scripts, and restricted-context validation scripts. Each instance records
source provenance, repository metadata, and line-level context annotations. The evaluation pipeline
consumes ranked-region predictions and produces both per-instance metrics and aggregate tables.

Compute. Sparse retrieval baselines run on CPU workers after repository indexing. Dense retrieval
additionally requires embedding computation but no fine-tuning. Agentic explorers and restricted-
context validation are the most expensive components because they require LLM calls and executable
harness runs. For each downstream run, we log the model, prompt, tool budget, wall-clock time,
patch status, and resolved status.

Limitations. SWE-Explore covers instances solved by at least one agent in our pool, so it does not
represent the full distribution of unsolved repository-level issues. Its trajectory-derived ground truth is
an empirical approximation of useful context, not a proof that no other evidence could support a valid
solution. Some valid solution paths may rely on different evidence than the successful trajectories
we observe. The restricted-context protocol should therefore be read as a controlled validation of
exploration metrics, rather than as an absolute measure of patch-generation ability.

Responsible release. SWE-Explore is derived from public software-engineering benchmarks and
public repository metadata. The release excludes private repositories, credentials, and user data.
