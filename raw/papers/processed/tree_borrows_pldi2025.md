The Rust programming language is well known for its ownership-based type system, which offers strong
guarantees like memory safety and data race freedom. However, Rust also provides unsafe escape hatches,
for which safety is not guaranteed automatically and must instead be manually upheld by the programmer.
This creates a tension. On the one hand, compilers would like to exploit the strong guarantees of the type
system—particularly those pertaining to aliasing of pointers—in order to unlock powerful intraprocedural
optimizations. On the other hand, those optimizations are easily invalidated by “badly behaved” unsafe code.
To ensure correctness of such optimizations, it thus becomes necessary to clearly define what unsafe code is
“badly behaved.” In prior work, Stacked Borrows defined a set of rules achieving this goal. However, Stacked
Borrows rules out several patterns that turn out to be common in real-world unsafe Rust code, and it does not
account for advanced features of the Rust borrow checker that were introduced more recently.

To resolve these issues, we present Tree Borrows. As the name suggests, Tree Borrows is defined by replacing
the stack at the heart of Stacked Borrows with a tree. This overcomes the aforementioned limitations: our
evaluation on the 30 000 most widely used Rust crates shows that Tree Borrows rejects 54% fewer test cases
than Stacked Borrows does. Additionally, we prove (in Rocq) that it retains most of the Stacked Borrows
optimizations and also enables important new ones, notably read-read reorderings.

1 Introduction
Type systems have been enormously effective at ruling out entire classes of bugs in an efficient and
compositional way. A recent success story is Rust, which uses affine (“ownership-based”) types and
lifetimes (a variant of region types) to statically ensure type safety, memory safety, and data race
freedom for lower-level systems programming applications without requiring a garbage collector.
However, the benefits of type systems go beyond “just” ensuring that programs don’t go wrong:
type systems can also help to make programs go fast. Indeed, from very early on, the Rust compiler
has used its type system not only to ensure type safety, but also to inform optimizations. Specifically,
Rust’s types encode powerful aliasing information: all references are either aliased or mutable,

but never both at the same time. Alias analysis is a central pillar of modern optimizers, and so
unsurprisingly Rust compiler developers want to feed the omnipresent type information into alias
analysis. Let us consider a concrete example:

fn write_both(x: &mut i32, y: &mut i32) -> i32 {

*x = 13;
*y = 20;
*x // Transformation: return 13

}

Example 1

This function takes two mutable references as arguments, so by the rules of the Rust type system,
these references cannot alias. It follows that the function must always return 13, so we should be
able to remove the read from *x on the last line and hard-code the return value to 13 without
affecting the program’s behavior. Although this is a contrived example, it is representative of the
kind of program transformation that unlocks powerful intraprocedural optimizations, despite the
relevant memory locations having been allocated elsewhere in the program.

1.1 The Challenge of Allowing Aliasing Optimizations in the Presence of Unsafe Code
Unfortunately, the reality of Rust is more complicated. Although the Rust type system provides
strong aliasing guarantees, they can be too strong, preventing programmers from implementing
certain abstractions (e.g., those that rely on mutation of shared state) or from achieving the desired
performance. As a result, programmers sometimes circumvent the restrictions of the type system
through the use of unsafe escape hatches—notably raw pointers, whose aliasing is untracked. To
ensure that reasoning about type safety remains compositional, Rust programmers wrap their
unsafe code in safe abstractions. For instance, the Vec type from the standard library, which provides
a resizable array, is internally implemented with unsafe code—but the public API provided to the
user is safe. This means that millions of lines of code can use Vec without worrying about type
safety, and only the few thousand lines of code implementing Vec require extra scrutiny.

The problem with unsafe code is that it can do things like this:

fn main() {

let mut x = 42;
let ptr = &mut x as *mut i32;
let val = unsafe { write_both(&mut *ptr, &mut *ptr) };
println!("{val}");

}

Example 2

This code creates a raw pointer ptr to a mutable local variable x. It then uses the unsafe code
block to convert the same raw pointer to a mutable reference twice (via &mut *ptr), thus ending
up with two aliasing mutable references. The program will thus print 20 when compiled without
optimizations, but would print 13 if write_both were optimized as described above. That’s bad!
Optimizations are not supposed to change program behavior.

Given that aliasing optimizations are something that the Rust compiler developers clearly want to
support, we need some way of “ruling out” counterexamples like the one above from consideration.
Rust programmers are already used to the fact that using unsafe features does not mean they can do
whatever they want: unsafe code authors must pay careful attention to special rules. For instance,
when using the get_unchecked function, which accesses an array without a bounds check, unsafe
code authors must ensure that the index is in-bounds of the array. Unsafe code which does not
hold up those requirements is said to be inducing Undefined Behavior (UB), because the resulting
program could misbehave in arbitrary ways. Consequently, unsafe code authors have an implied

obligation to ensure that their code is free of UB; the compiler will in turn trust the programmer
and just assume that the code it compiles does not have UB.

To save the reference-based optimization in Example 1, we need to find a way to make the
program in Example 2 have UB. However, this is harder than it may seem. For instance, the
following entirely safe Rust snippet may seem like it causes aliasing of mutable references as well:

let mut x = 42;
let ref1 = &mut x;
let ref2 = &mut *ref1;
*ref2 = 12;
println!("{ref1}"); // Will print 12.

Example 3

Both ref1 and ref2 are pointing to x. How can this be allowed, when Rust does not permit aliasing
of mutable references? The answer is that this is a case of reborrowing: ref2 is derived from ref1,
and so the compiler allows the two to coexist. However, for the duration that ref2 is live, ref1
may not be used, and when ref1 is used again, that is the end of the lifetime of ref2. If we added a
println!("{ref2}"); at the end of Example 3, it would get rejected for violating this discipline.
The challenging task ahead therefore lies in defining UB in such a way that Example 2 is rejected,
but all safe Rust code is accepted. In fact, we have to go even further and ensure that enough
“reasonable” unsafe Rust code is accepted: for unsafe Rust to be useful, it must be possible to write
correct unsafe code with modest effort.

1.2 Prior Work: Stacked Borrows
We are not the first to tackle this challenge: Stacked Borrows [12] had exactly the same goal. The key
observation behind Stacked Borrows was that in cases like Example 3, all currently valid pointers
can be organized in a stack, with x at the bottom of the stack, ref1 on top, and finally ref2. The
stack models the fact that all uses of these references must be well-nested: the moment ref1 is used,
ref2 has been invalidated. Unfortunately, this simple stack model has three major problems.

The first problem is that Stacked Borrows prohibits some basic optimizations, such as reordering
adjacent reads. The reason for this is simple: in Example 3, if we read from ref2 and then from
ref1, this is perfectly fine. ref2 is “nested inside” ref1, so all accesses are permitted. However,
after reordering the two operations, we would be first reading from ref1 and then reading from
ref2. This is UB under Stacked Borrows, since it violates the well-nested requirement. Reordering
reads is a crucial optimization, so this is a significant flaw.1

The second problem is that Stacked Borrows restricts references to a static range: when a reference
is created, the type of the reference determines the range of memory it may access, and no memory
outside that range can ever be accessed with this reference or any raw pointer derived from it. In
practice, this is often not what programmers expect. For example, programmers coming from C
will routinely create a reference to the first element of an array, turn it into a raw pointer, and then
use that to access the entire array. Stacked Borrows rejects this, since a raw pointer derived from a
reference to the first element of an array may only access that one element. This mismatch between
programmers’ expectations and the model leads to frequent UB in real-world code [1, 3, 5, 6, 8], so
it is worth exploring alternative, more permissive options.

The third problem is quite technical. It relates to a feature of the Rust borrow checker that was
developed concurrently with Stacked Borrows, called two-phase borrows. This feature weakens

1Instead of replacing Stacked Borrows wholesale, this flaw could be overcome by using a different model for the IR on
which optimizations are performed. However, that would still necessitate the development of a new model, and that model
would be subject to the additional constraint of having to be a refinement of Stacked Borrows, i.e., the IR model can only
have less UB than the surface model. For this work, we decided to instead replace Stacked Borrows entirely.

the requirements for some mutable references so that they do not have to be immediately unique;
instead, they are created in a reservation phase that permits read-only aliasing. Uniqueness is only
enforced upon activation of the mutable reference, which must occur before the first write.

The original Stacked Borrows model did not support two-phase borrows at all. The implementa-
tion of Stacked Borrows that Rust programmers can use to check their code for UB has rudimentary
support: to check today’s Rust code that routinely uses two-phase borrows, the implementation
treats two-phase borrows basically equivalent to raw pointers. However, this rudimentary support
has some very counter-intuitive consequences that regularly confuse Rust programmers, as is
demonstrated by the example below:

fn write(x: &mut i32) { *x = 10; }

Example 4

let x = &mut 0;
let y = x as *mut i32; // derive raw pointer from x
write(x); // write to x
unsafe { *y = 15 }; // use raw pointer

This program is accepted by Stacked Borrows. However, if we replace the call to write by its
body, then it is rejected by Stacked Borrows.2 The reason for this difference is that write(x)
is implicitly expanded to write(&twophase x), where &twophase is pseudo-syntax marking an
implicit mutable reference that is subject to the rules of two-phase borrows, and hence treated
like a raw pointer by the Stacked Borrows implementation. Not only does this difference confuse
programmers, the fact that implicitly created mutable references are treated like raw pointers also
limits the potential for optimizations.

1.3 Our Contribution: Tree Borrows
In this paper, we show how to overcome all these limitations with a new aliasing model for Rust,
which we call Tree Borrows:

• To support two-phase borrows, we use a tree instead of a stack to track the relationship of
references. A tree is a natural choice since each reference has a unique parent: the refer-
ence/local variable it is created from. A stack imposes the additional constraint that at most
one child of each reference can matter at any given time, but with two-phase borrows this
does not suffice: there may be a reserved mutable reference and several shared references
peacefully co-existing in the reservation phase of the mutable reference. They have to be
tracked as independent children of the same parent reference, so that when the mutable
reference gets activated, its siblings can no longer be used.

• To allow reordering of reads, each node in the tree tracks a state machine representing the
current permissions of the reference that is represented by this node. These permissions
change as the memory the reference points to is read and written by this or other references.
This is in contrast to Stacked Borrows, in which the permissions of a reference are fixed upon
creation and never changed until it is invalidated.

• Finally, we replace Stacked Borrows’ static reference ranges by dynamic reference ranges,
which place no fixed bound on the region of memory for which a reference claims uniqueness
(or immutability). Instead, that region is determined based on how the reference is used. This
crucially relies on the tree structure that lets us track multiple siblings without deciding
upfront which one will be unique for which part of memory.

2This may seem like Stacked Borrows does not permit inlining, but it is more subtle than that. The difference in behavior
arises from a difference in how surface Rust is elaborated into the compiler’s internal IR; inlining on the level of that IR is
sound with Stacked Borrows.

188:5

To empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Tree Borrows, we have implemented it in Miri, the
same tool that was also used to evaluate Stacked Borrows. We have carried out an experiment on
the 30 000 most downloaded Rust libraries, and confirmed that Tree Borrows rejects 54% fewer test
cases than Stacked Borrows does. We have also formally modeled Tree Borrows in Rocq, and used
the Simuliris [9] framework to build a relational program logic that can prove correctness of Tree
Borrows optimizations. Almost all optimizations shown for Stacked Borrows still hold for Tree
Borrows; the only exceptions are optimizations that insert new writes before the first write in the
original program—this is part of the trade-off of adapting Tree Borrows to be more compatible with
real-world code. In particular, the aliasing optimizations the Rust compiler already performs (like
Example 1 above) are all, to our knowledge, supported by Tree Borrows. Moreover, unlike Stacked
Borrows, Tree Borrows enables us to prove that reordering adjacent reads is sound.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: We begin with an example-driven introduction to
the core of Tree Borrows (§2). Next, we extend Tree Borrows with protectors, which significantly
strengthens the optimizations we can perform (§3). Afterwards, we perform a detailed comparison of
our new model with its predecessor, Stacked Borrows, including the empirical evaluation mentioned
above (§4). Finally, we show some examples of optimizations that we have proven correct for Tree
Borrows (§5), and conclude with a discussion of related and future work (§6, §7).

2 The Basics of Tree Borrows
In this section, we explain the basic mechanisms behind Tree Borrows’ tracking of references and
detection of UB. We assume no prior knowledge of Rust or Stacked Borrows.

2.1 Keeping Track of Aliases
The key idea of Tree Borrows is given away in its name: references are organized in a tree. For
instance, consider this example:

let mut root = 42;
let ref1 = &mut root;
let ref2 = &mut *ref1;
let ref3 = &mut root;

root

ref3

ref1

ref2

Example 5

Here we have a local variable, root, and several references derived directly or indirectly from that
variable. The tree on the right indicates how Tree Borrows views the relationship between these
references and the local variable. Every newly created reference is associated with a new node in
the tree, inserted as a child of the node that was used to create this reference. So, a reference is
not just a location into memory; instead, it is defined by a pair of a location and an identifier that
determines its corresponding node in the tree. We call this identifier the tag of the reference.

Effects of an access. Every time a memory access occurs, Tree Borrows “informs” all references
about this access. Each reference, i.e., each node in the tree, tracks a state machine, which defines
how the reference “reacts” to that access: the access can either be permitted (possibly switching to
a different state), or rejected, in which case the program has UB.

The transitions of the state machine are indexed by whether the access was a read or a write,
and by the relationship of the currently considered reference with the reference that was used for
the access. Specifically, we distinguish local accesses from foreign accesses. When computing the
next state machine transition for a node with tag 𝑡sm after an access to tag 𝑡acc, the access is a local
access to 𝑡sm if 𝑡acc is “derived from” 𝑡sm, i.e., if it is 𝑡sm itself or one of its children; it is a foreign
access if 𝑡acc is a parent or cousin of 𝑡sm. For instance, in Example 5 above, if we consider 𝑡sm =
ref1, then an access to ref1 or ref2 would be considered local, and an access to ref3 or root

2.2 Lifetime of a Mutable Reference
We will now slowly define the state machine, the full version of which is shown in Figure 1. Most of
the state machine can be understood by discussing mutable references. We thus begin by explaining
a simplified model of mutable references, and then extend it until it is able to accept all safe code,
and allows our desired optimizations.

A naive model of mutable references. For inspiration on how to handle mutable references,
we first turn to the component of the Rust compiler that ensures correct usage of references—the
borrow checker. We start with a very simple example:

let mut root = 42;
let x = &mut root;
*x += 1;
root = 0

root

x

Example 6

Here, the mutable reference x is created by the expression &mut root, making it a child of root.
The borrow checker will determine that the lifetime of x begins at &mut root, and cannot continue
further than root = 0. There, the parent reference reclaims ownership which must kill x. Any
further attempt to use x will raise a compilation error that x’s lifetime has expired. In the interval
between those operations, while x is live, we are free to read from and write to x. This desired
behavior can easily be expressed in our framework of permissions and local/foreign accesses:
we use two permissions, Unique and Disabled, to represent live and dead mutable references,
respectively. Initially, the mutable reference is given the permission Unique, and as long as it is
Unique it tolerates arbitrary local accesses. When a foreign access occurs, this means that a parent
reference has reclaimed ownership of the pointee. Hence, we transition the permission to Disabled,
and from that point onwards any local accesses to x trigger UB.

Despite its simplicity, this model already captures most of the desired semantics of mutable
references. For example, it rejects sequences of events that contain a foreign write followed by
a local write, thereby properly enforcing unique ownership. To illustrate this, recall Example 2
in which unsafe code creates two mutable references to the same location, and passes both as
arguments to a safe function. We found that this is in violation of uniqueness of mutable references,
and therefore, the code in question should be declared Undefined Behavior. We now consider that
same piece of code again (with Example 1 inlined for brevity) under the current model, showing
that it does indeed detect UB.

let mut root = 42;

let val = *x;

root

188:7

Example 7

We track the state of x and y: both are created by &mut *ptr, which means they are mutable
references and derived indirectly from root. The reference y is a cousin of x, so accesses through y
appear as foreign accesses from the point of view of x, and vice-versa. Executing *x = 13 causes a
local write to x (making it Unique) and a foreign write to y (making it Disabled). Next, *y = 20 is
a local write to a Disabled node, which is UB, as expected.

In summary, our model successfully rules out aliasing between x and y here (and in Example 1).
Despite such a promising result for such a simple model, having only Unique and Disabled proves
to be insufficient. We now show two ways in which the previous model should be refined.

Two-phase borrows and the Reserved state. In Example 4, we showed two-phase borrows, the
handling of which is one of the main motivations for introducing Tree Borrows. Our simplified
Unique/Disabled model currently lacks support for these.

The standard example [30] for a two-phase borrow is v.push(v.len()), where v is of type

Vec<usize>. After desugaring the notations for method calls, this becomes roughly:

let v_for_push = &twophase v;
let v_for_len = &v;
let len = Vec::len(v_for_len);
Vec::push(v_for_push, len);

v

Example 8

v_for_push

v_for_len

The first line computes the first argument for push, the next two lines compute the second argument
(where the call to len has also been desugared to its more explicit form). If we take the perspective
of v_for_push, then after the reference is created, it is subjected to a foreign read when Vec::len
reads the length of the vector. According to the state machine as we have described it so far, that
would transition its state to Disabled, thus causing Undefined Behavior later in Vec::push! The
naive model thus fails to account for the fact that this safe code should be permitted.

Example 8, in fact, used to be rejected by the borrow checker, basically for the same reason that
our naive model rejects it. To overcome this, the Rust compiler developers introduced the concept
of two-phase borrows, where some3 mutable references begin their life with a reservation phase.
During the reservation phase, arbitrary read accesses to the memory the reference points to are
allowed, even via other references. After activation, which occurs as a side-effect of the first write
to the mutable reference, it becomes a full mutable reference and no longer tolerates aliases. We can
incorporate this behavior in Tree Borrows by creating a new permission to model the behavior of
mutable references during their reservation phase. Fittingly, we call this permission Reserved. From
now on, mutable references start out as Reserved, not as Unique. Reserved allows local and foreign
reads, thereby allowing all reads during the reservation phase. When the reference is activated,
i.e., when it first experiences a local write, its permission changes to a full-fledged Unique; and as
before, when Unique experiences a foreign access, it becomes Disabled.

Enabling read-read reorderings with the Frozen state. Read-only accesses are usually con-
sidered to be free of side effects, so compilers are usually allowed to reorder adjacent read-only
operations: the two programs let vx = *x; let vy = *y; and let vy = *y; let vx = *x;

3Two-phase borrows only apply to implicit reborrows, i.e., they do not occur when the source code contains “&mut”
syntactically. Tree Borrows ignores this distinction and gives a reservation phase to all mutable references.

should be equivalent in any context.4 However, in our aliasing model, read accesses are not side
effect-free! Indeed, the simple act of reading data has an effect on the state machines maintained in
each node. For example, a foreign read could very well change a Unique into Disabled.

Unfortunately, in the current draft of the state machine, adjacent reads cannot in general be
reordered. For example, in a context where x is Unique and a child of root (this configuration is
easily generated for example by let mut root = 0; let x = &mut root; *x = 42;) we find
that reading from x then root is fine, but reading from root then x results in UB (the read through
root is foreign for x, making it Disabled, and thus further reads are UB). We can pinpoint this issue
on the specific transition from Unique to Disabled wherein a foreign read (through root) causes a
readable reference (x currently Unique) to lose read permissions (becomes Disabled).

This suggests that upon a foreign read, a Unique reference should not immediately lose the
ability to read, only to write. To fix this shortcoming, we introduce a new permission, which we
call Frozen. This new permission is added as an intermediate step between Unique and Disabled,
reached when a Unique experiences a foreign read and exited when Frozen experiences a foreign
write. A Frozen tag allows arbitrary local and foreign read accesses. Now both orderings of reading
root then x or x then root result in the same state, with x being Frozen and still tolerating read
accesses. By introducing Frozen, we have made read-read reorderings possible again, making it a
rare case where having less UB leads to more optimizations!

Dealing with ranges of memory. So far, we pretended that each reference only has a single
state. This is correct as long as we only consider a single location in memory. To support multiple
locations, we use a CompCert-like [20, 19] memory model where memory is organized in contiguous
allocations, each of which consists of a certain number of bytes. A memory location is a tuple (𝑎, 𝑜),
where 𝑎 identifies the allocation, and 𝑜 the offset into that block. Thus, a reference consists of
three components, ((𝑎, 𝑜), 𝑡), also featuring the tag 𝑡. Tree Borrows tracks a tree of tags for each
allocation. Furthermore, there is an instance of the aforementioned state machine for each location,
i.e., the same tag can be in a different state at different offsets in the allocation. When an access
affects more than one location (such as a 4-byte load that reads from 4 locations), we independently
update the state machine for all tags in this allocation’s tree for each of these locations. If any of
these state machines transitions to UB, the overall access is UB.

2.3 Beyond Mutable References
So far we have considered only mutable references, but Rust has more pointer-like types: shared
references are the dual to mutable references in the sense that they permit aliasing, but no mutation.
And raw pointers are Rust’s unsafe pointer construct that cannot be used in safe Rust, but permits
arbitrary aliasing. In this section we show that our current model easily accomodates both of these,
without requiring any new permissions to be introduced.

Shared references. Shared references are permitted to alias arbitrarily with other shared refer-
ences (and also with mutable references in their reservation phase) and allow read accesses, but no
write accesses, as long as they are live. In terms of our state machine, the permission that represents
shared references must allow local and foreign reads, and trigger UB if a local write is attempted.
On foreign writes, the permission should become Disabled. But look: this exactly describes the
Frozen state! In addition to being a transitory permission for mutable references near the end of
their lifetime, Frozen is thus also the initial permission for shared references. This gives a new

4These are non-atomic accesses, so reordering reads is possible even in a concurrent program. If there were any race
conditions, that would be UB.

interpretation to the transition from Unique to Frozen for mutable references: when a mutable
reference can no longer uphold its uniqueness guarantee, it gets demoted to a shared reference.

Raw pointers. Raw pointers are Rust’s most permissive pointer type, to be used only when doing
low level manipulations that references cannot support. Multiple raw pointers to the same location
can exist simultaneously, all aliasing each other, and all of them may have write permissions. As
long as they respect the lifetime and mutability limitations of their parent reference, there is very
little that raw pointers are not allowed to do.

In Tree Borrows, the creation of a raw pointer is a no-op: raw pointers do not get a new tag and
thus inherit the tag of the reference that they are created from. This means that if multiple raw
pointers are created from the same reference, accesses through them can be arbitrarily interleaved—
the aliasing model considers them all as coming from the same “source”, namely the reference they
are derived from. Once that reference comes to the end of its lifetime (i.e., when its permission
becomes Disabled), all the raw pointers are also invalidated.

let mut root = 42;
let ref1 = &mut root;
let ptr1 = ref1 as *mut i32;
unsafe {

*ref1 = 43;
*ptr1 = 44;
*ref1 = 45;

}

Example 9

root

ref1, ptr1

In this code, the entire line let ptr1 = ref1 as *mut i32; is a no-op from the point of view
of Tree Borrows, and ptr1 is thereafter considered identical to ref1. Although the final three
assignments assign to syntactically different variables, Tree Borrows at runtime sees only the tags,
which are all equivalent. So Tree Borrows accepts this code, as intended, since raw pointers are
supposed to allow aliasing.

Tree Borrows even allows raw pointers to access memory outside the range determined by the

type of their parent reference, as in the example below:

let mut v = [0u8, 0];
let x = &mut v[0];
let y = (x as *mut i32).add(1);
unsafe { *y = 1; }

x, y

Example 10

In this example, x is a mutable reference to the first element of v. Using a raw pointer cast and
pointer arithmetic, we create y, which has the same tag as x but points to the second element of
v. In particular, y points outside the bounds of the reference x it is derived from! This pattern is
not uncommon in low-level code. In particular, it is useful when implementing a form of ad-hoc
dynamic polymorphism, in which the data at the prefix of some block provides information about
the shape of the data that follows it. Since this information goes beyond what can be expressed in
static types, the latter data must be accessed with raw pointers.

In Tree Borrows, we do support such code—Example 10 above is accepted. The way this works is
that &mut v[0] creates a permission and associated state machine for the new reference everywhere
in the current allocation, not just in the memory range indicated by the type. This means that
the permission at offset 1, indicated in gray because it is outside the type-indicated range, is also
Reserved. It is thus possible to dynamically extend a reference to a larger range, using unsafe code.
At the same time, the model (using the mechanisms already introduced above) still ensures that
raw pointers derived from different mutable references are only used to mutate disjoint parts of
memory.

2.4 Interior Mutability
Rust’s references prevent mutation of aliased state, but having access to shared mutable state is
sometimes necessary. Rust supports this via the mechanism of interior mutability, which permits
exposing carefully controlled forms of shared mutable state using a library type that is internally
implemented with unsafe code. Types with interior mutability do not uphold the usual aliasing
guarantees of Rust, and are therefore required to use the special type UnsafeCell<T> that acts as a
marker to indicate that the inner data of type T can be mutated through a shared reference.

In terms of aliasing, shared references to interior mutable types are basically equivalent to raw
pointers, so Tree Borrows models them the same: interior mutable shared references inherit the
tag of their parent reference. This immediately trivializes the handling of these references; just like
raw pointers, they can freely alias with other raw pointers derived from the same parent.

Mutable references to interior mutable types are indistinguishable from regular mutable refer-
ences as soon as they become Unique. However, during their reservation phase, shared references
can exist, and since these references permit mutation, a mutable reference in the reservation phase
must tolerate not only foreign reads but also foreign writes. Such a case is shown in Example 11,
which is like Example 8, but here c has type Cell<i32>, which has interior mutability. As such,
the function Cell::replace is allowed to write to the cell and this write must not cause c_mut to
become Disabled. To model this, we introduce a new permission ReservedIM which is identical to
Reserved except for the fact that it allows foreign writes. ReservedIM is the new entry point into
the state machine for mutable references to interior mutable types.

fn foo(c : &mut Cell<i32>, n : i32) { *c.get_mut() = n; }

let mut c = Cell::new(1);
let c_mut = &twophase c;
let c_shr = &c;
let val = Cell::replace(c_shr, 42); // performs a write
foo(c_mut, val);

3 Advanced Tree Borrows: Ensuring That References Stay Alive
In the previous section, we developed an aliasing model that accepts all safe Rust code while
ruling out some unsafe code that we identified as problematic. Unfortunately, the aliasing model
is pretty weak in terms of the optimizations it enables: there are optimizations the Rust compiler
already performs today that are not justified by the model we have explained so far. Specifically,
the compiler assumes that a reference passed as function argument is unique/immutable for the
entire duration of that function call, and uses that to optimize the following example.

fn write_and_call(x: &mut i32, opaque: impl Fn()) {
*x = 13; // Transformation: eliminate this write
opaque();
*x = 20;

caller

write_and_call

Example 12

?

opaque

?

x

}

Here, opaque is a closure that takes no arguments and does not return anything. Our goal is to
eliminate the first write. Note that this is a quite powerful optimization: x points to memory that
was allocated in an unknown way, and opaque is arbitrary unknown code—it is generally not
possible to do any aliasing optimizations in a situation like this!

Intuitively, Tree Borrows should make this possible because opaque cannot possibly access the
memory that x points to. After all, opaque would have to use some alias that is foreign to x (as
indicated to the right of the code) to access the same memory. That should be UB since it violates

Tree Borrows

188:11

uniqueness of x: such an access would transition x from Unique to Disabled, so *x = 20 would be
UB. However, the problem is that opaque might never return, in which case the *x = 20 would
never be executed and cannot cause UB. This is demonstrated by the following context:

let mut root = 42;
let ptr1 = &mut root as *mut i32;
let opaque = move || {
let ptr2 = ptr1;
println!("{}", unsafe { *ptr2 });
std::process::exit(0); // quit program

};
write_and_call(unsafe { &mut *ptr1 }, opaque);

Example 13

root

caller

ptr1, ptr2

opaque

write_and_call

x

Here, opaque is carefully chosen so that it performs an access with a tag that is foreign to x, and
then never returns. Applying the desired optimization will make the code print 42 instead of 13,
showing that this code is in conflict with the desired optimization. At the same time, this context
does not exhibit UB according to the model of Figure 1: x transitions from Unique to Frozen due to
the foreign read at *ptr2 , and is never accessed again due to the infinite loop.

To fix this, we introduce a mechanism called protectors (inspired by Stacked Borrows [12], which
also has such a mechanism). Protectors “protect” a reference for the duration of a function call,
ensuring they do not get invalidated prematurely. This changes what happens at the load of *ptr2
inside opaque: without protectors, this just transitions x to Frozen; if x is protected, this operation
will instead be Undefined Behavior, even if x is never used again.

3.1 Putting Tags Under Protection
Concretely, we attach a boolean flag to each tag that indicates that this tag must currently not
become Disabled. Such a tag is called protected. We also introduce some virtual operations at the
beginning of each function call that equip all references in function arguments with a fresh tag (as
if they had been reborrowed), and mark that fresh tag as protected. The protector flag is removed
when the function returns. Intuitively, this ensures that for the duration that the function runs,
references that are passed as arguments to the function cannot be invalidated. In Example 12, the
tag of x is protected for the entirety of the execution of the function write_and_call.

Note that protectors special-case function boundaries. This is justified because in Rust, the borrow
checker ensures that a reference passed to a function always outlives that function. Protectors are
the operational semantics equivalent of this outlives requirement. Furthermore, the Rust compiler
already special-cases references in function argument position when passing code to its LLVM
backend, to let LLVM perform optimizations based on the non-aliasing of references. Tree Borrows
protectors are ensuring that the requirements LLVM imposes are upheld by UB-free Rust code.

When a tag is protected, instead of transitioning to Disabled, the corresponding operations
immediately trigger UB. This is the core function of protectors: they ensure that a reference stays
alive while it is protected. Furthermore, a protected Unique reference triggers immediate UB on a
foreign read (instead of transitioning to Frozen); this is required to ensure that Example 13 is UB.
This is enough to justify the transformation in Example 12. However, it turns out it is not enough
to justify everything the Rust compiler already assumes about mutable references. To see why,
consider the example below, which represents an optimization that the Rust compiler performs:

}
Given all we said so far, this transformation would introduce UB in a program where x and y
alias. The write to y would change its state to Unique, and therefore the subsequent foreign read
through x would not be permitted. We must thus ensure that if a mutable reference is written
to at any point of the function call, then there was no foreign read at any point during the call.
Protectors as explained above already rule out foreign reads after the write (since a foreign read on
a Unique reference is UB), but extra care needs to be taken to ensure there hasn’t been a foreign
read before the write. To do this, we introduce a boolean flag in the Reserved state which records
that a foreign read took place. This flag is called conflicted. A conflicted Reserved reference cannot
become Unique; a local write to such a reference will instead trigger UB.

To ensure that this optimization can also be performed when y is a mutable reference to an
interior mutable type, we change the initial state for protected mutable references to be always
Reserved, no matter whether they point to interior mutable data or not.

The end result is that for any mutable reference that is passed as argument to a function, it is UB

for this reference to encounter both a foreign read and a local write—in any order.

3.2 Implicit Accesses
Given that protectors guarantee that their tags are live for the entirety of the function call, this
should enable optimizations that introduce spurious reads: speculatively reading from a location
that is not guaranteed to be read from in all executions. For example, consider the function below,
in which a shared reference x is accessed n times:

fn repeat(x: &i32, n: usize, opaque: impl Fn(i32)) {
// let val = *x;

// Transformation: insert load

Example 15

for _ in 0..n {
opaque(*x);

}

}

// Transformation: replace *x by val

caller

repeat

?

x

The value of *x is constant for the entirety of the execution of repeat; this is guaranteed by the
protector on x which prevents foreign writes. Thus, we would like to optimize this function to read
the value only once instead of n times. However, if n is 0, then we are inserting a read where none
occurred, and this might trigger UB.

Proc. ACM Program. Lang., Vol. 9, No. PLDI, Article 188. Publication date: June 2025.

Tree Borrows

188:13

To ensure that inserting a read cannot trigger UB, we define our semantics such that even if
the original function did not explicitly read x, we implicitly apply all the effects of a read access.
Specifically, every time a fresh tag is generated, we update the entire tree as-if the program
performed a read via this fresh tag. The size of the read access is determined by the type of the
reference. We refer to operations that create a fresh tag as retags (they occur every time a reference
is created, and at the beginning of each function call), so we can summarize this section as saying
that retags implicitly execute a read. Note that these implicit reads also occur for non-protected
references, and that even for &mut references we only perform implicit reads, not writes.

It is important to note that while the implicit read of a fresh reference, say of type &mut i32, is
only as large as the type of the reference indcates (in this case, 4 bytes), it is still possible to use raw
pointers derived from this reference outside that memory range. The protector is enforced for all
locations that the reference has actually been used for. For instance, earlier in Example 10 where we
reborrowed an array only partially, let x = &mut v[0] initializes x with the permission Reserved
on all 8 bytes of the allocation, but only the first 4 bytes receive an implicit read. These 4 bytes are
always considered used; any usage beyond that is determined dynamically. These are the dynamic
reference ranges we mentioned in the introduction.

Protector end semantics. For reasons that are more subtle (see §5), we also need implicit
accesses when a tag’s protector is being removed: all used Reserved or Frozen locations are subject
to an implicit read, and all used Unique locations are subject to an implicit write. In both cases,
the access is only applied to foreign tags. Intuitively, by performing implicit accesses both at the
beginning and end of a reference’s lifetime, we give the model maximal freedom to reorder accesses
and insert new spurious accesses without introducing UB.

4 Experimental Comparison with Stacked Borrows Using Miri
In the introduction, we motivated Tree Borrows as overcoming several limitations of Stacked
Borrows. We now return to this point with a more in-depth explanation of how Tree Borrows
differs from Stacked Borrows, along with an experimental evaluation of whether we succeeded in
better aligning the model with programmers’ expectations.

4.1 Differences between Tree Borrows and Stacked Borrows
Overall, Tree Borrows accepts many patterns not accepted by Stacked Borrows, but there are
some cases in which Stacked Borrows accepts more code than Tree Borrows. We now look at
the differences between the models in a bit more detail: we explain how the general structure
of Stacked Borrows differs from that of Tree Borrows, how Stacked Borrows handles references
(which is structurally fairly similar to how Tree Borrows handles references, just with a different
state machine), and how Stacked Borrows handles raw pointers (which is quite different).

Like Tree Borrows, every reference and raw pointer in Stacked Borrows carries a tag to distinguish
it from other references and raw pointers with the same address. However, as the name indicates,
Stacked Borrows works with a stack, not a tree. We can cast Stacked Borrows in the same mental
framework as Tree Borrows by considering the stack to be equivalent to a tree with a branching
factor of 1, where the bottom of the stack is the root of the tree.5

References. Stacked Borrows references can be fairly easily described in the framework of Tree
Borrows. There is no Reserved state; mutable references start out Unique and they become Disabled
on any foreign access—just like the first naive model of mutable references at the beginning of §2.2.
Shared references are treated basically the same in Stacked Borrows and Tree Borrows, but since

5So unlike normal trees, this one grows upwards.

188:14

Neven Villani, Johannes Hostert, Derek Dreyer, and Ralf Jung

Stacked Borrows cannot represent branching, all shared references derived from the same mutable
reference are stacked on top of each other. Since shared references are unaffected by foreign reads,
and do not allow any writes, it does not make a difference whether they are tracked as unordered
siblings, or whether they are put into some total order.

As already mentioned, Stacked Borrows also has no proper support for two-phase mutable
references, and the implementation treats them like raw pointers. This is an oversimplification of
how two-phase borrows work, and accepts way too much code—it accepts arbitrary aliasing of the
two-phase mutable reference with a raw pointer. Tree Borrows rejects such aliasing if it violates the
guarantees of two-phase borrows, i.e., the two-phase mutable reference must be truly unique after
its activating write. Furthermore, Tree Borrows makes no difference between mutable references
with or without two-phase treatment by the borrow checker: they all start in the Reserved state.
This avoids surprising changes in behavior when an implicit reference is made explicit.

Stacked Borrows has protectors, and they work like a simpler version of Tree Borrows protectors:
there is no implicit access when a protector is removed, and no tracking of which locations are
conflicted or used. Tree Borrows needs that tracking to support two-phase borrows and dynamic
reference ranges, neither of which are supported by Stacked Borrows.

Raw pointers. Raw pointers work quite differently in Stacked Borrows: in the original model as
described in the paper, raw pointers are untagged (see [12, §3.3]). When a reference is cast to a raw
pointer, the stack records that this reference has an untagged “child”; accesses through an untagged
pointer are only allowed when such a suitable untagged record exists on the stack. However, it
turned out that this has some rather problematic consequences [22, 4], and therefore the Stacked
Borrows implementation was eventually updated to also track a tag for raw pointers [2]. However,
this tag is still distinct from the tag of the reference that the raw pointer is created from.

The initial permission of a raw pointer in Stacked Borrows is SharedReadWrite (abbreviated
to SharedRW), which does not correspond to any Tree Borrows permission. It is unaffected by
most accesses, except for foreign writes performed via a Unique pointer—those disable even a
SharedReadWrite pointer. In other words, to cast Stacked Borrows in terms of Tree Borrows, the
state machine needs to know not only the kind of access and the relative position in the tree of
the tag that was used for the access and the tag under consideration, but also the permission of
the tag used for the access.6 Furthermore, reads via a pointer with SharedRW have a very special
interaction with Unique children. This is best demonstrated by comparing how Tree Borrows (left)
and Stacked Borrows (right) interpret the example below:

root: Unique

tmp, ptr: Reserved

let mut root = 0;
let tmp = &mut root;
let ptr = tmp as *mut i32;

Example 16

ptr: SharedRW
tmp: Unique
root: Unique

tmp, ptr now Unique
tmp, ptr now Frozen
UB under Tree Borrows

unsafe { *ptr = 1; }
let _val = root;
unsafe { *ptr = 2; }

tmp now Disabled; ptr still SharedRW
OK under Stacked Borrows

This code is accepted by Stacked Borrows, but rejected by Tree Borrows. A fundamental difference
between the two is that Stacked Borrows sees a distinction between ptr and tmp whereas Tree
Borrows does not. Tree Borrows rejects this code because ptr is a child of root, and after the
assignment storing 1 in ptr, its permission becomes Unique. This means that the read from root
in the next line transitions ptr to Frozen, and the subsequent store of 2 is Undefined Behavior.

6Stacked Borrows can be described more elegantly than that in its own terms. Here, we are deliberately casting it in the
terms of Tree Borrows to be able to properly compare both systems.

Proc. ACM Program. Lang., Vol. 9, No. PLDI, Article 188. Publication date: June 2025.

Tree Borrows

188:15

However, Stacked Borrows accepts Example 16 because it considers ptr to be a grandchild of root.
There is an additional mutable reference tmp between root and ptr. As a special “quirk” (sic),7
a read from root invalidates tmp, but does not invalidate ptr, leaving it SharedRW. Therefore,
further writes to ptr are permitted. This behavior cannot be explained while upholding a tree
structure, and in fact even the stack structure of Stacked Borrows is arguably violated here.

The reason Stacked Borrows behaves in this quirky way is to accept a fairly common pattern of
unsafe code. Specifically, the code that is given in the Stacked Borrows paper as the motivation for
this “quirk” is similar to Example 16 but does not involve any writes to ptr in between the creation
of ptr and the read from root. Such code is still accepted by Tree Borrows thanks to Tree Borrows’
treatment of all mutable references as two-phase borrows. In contrast, code like Example 16, in
which writes to ptr are interleaved both before and after the read from root, is not discussed in
the Stacked Borrows paper and is perhaps only accepted under Stacked Borrows by accident.

On the other hand, there are many cases where Tree Borrows accepts more code than Stacked
Borrows. In particular, Stacked Borrows bounds the memory ranges that can be accessed by a
reference, thus rejecting all code that uses raw pointers outside the range of the reference they
were derived from (determined by the type of the reference). For example, Example 10 is rejected
by Stacked Borrows: y is accessed outside the range of x. Another factor for accepting more code in
Tree Borrows is the fact that a raw pointer inherits the identity of its parent reference: when a raw
pointer is created like &raw mut root, Tree Borrows allows mixing accesses to the pointer and
to root, while Stacked Borrows does not. Both of these points (but especially the static bounds)
regularly confuse programmers, leading to bug reports and online discussions asking why code
examples get rejected [1, 3, 5, 6, 8].

4.2 Experimental Setup
As we have seen, Stacked Borrows and Tree Borrows are incomparable in terms of which model
accepts more code. However, we claim that Tree Borrows accepts a lot more code in practice. To
support this claim, we conducted an experiment around the following questions:
𝑄1: How much existing Rust code is supported in Tree Borrows, but not in Stacked Borrows, due

to UB that Tree Borrows has removed?

𝑄2: How much existing Rust code is broken in Tree Borrows, but not in Stacked Borrows, due to

UB that Tree Borrows has introduced?

To answer these questions, we tested large amounts of existing Rust for their conformance to
Tree Borrows’ (and Stacked Borrows’) rules, and compared the differences. We now discuss how
we did this, and then present and interpret the results.

Our experiments used crates.io and Miri. The first, crates.io, is Rust’s central package registry,
similar to npm for JavaScript. Almost all widely used Rust libraries are published there. The second
component is Miri. Miri is an implementation of Rust’s abstract machine that evaluates Rust (strictly)
according to the operational semantics. It is intended to be used in testing, letting unsafe code
authors detect UB bugs in their code.

For our experiment, we extended Miri with support for Tree Borrows. Miri already had support
for Stacked Borrows (as discussed in [12]), but introducing support for Tree Borrows and making
the specific aliasing model configurable required a moderate rearchitecting of Miri’s internals.
Besides this rearchitecting, the Tree Borrows implementation in Miri is mostly a direct translation
of the formal semantics. We also added some optimizations, e.g., one which can compact the tree
if intermediate nodes are determined to be unreachable, which avoids severe slowdowns and
out-of-memory errors. With a working Miri that can test code for both Tree Borrows and Stacked

(a) Filtering Run Results

(b) Results of Comparing Tree (TB) and Stacked Borrows (SB)

Fig. 3. Results of Running 674 748 Tests From 29 990 Crates

Borrows violations, as well as all other kinds of UB, we then ran the test suite of the 30 000 most
often downloaded crates on crates.io.

We would like to know the “amount of code” that is affected by Tree Borrows. As a first ap-
proximation, we could count the number of crates that are affected by Tree Borrows or Stacked
Borrows. But this would skew the numbers, since smaller crates with smaller test suites would be
over-represented. Instead, we analyze each test individually. Since larger crates tend to have more
features, which are tested by more tests, this also allows detecting if e.g., a crate is mostly compatible
with Tree Borrows, except for one feature, while being mostly incompatible with Stacked Borrows.
This allows our analysis to be more finely-grained.

For each of the 30 000 crates, the experiment then proceeds as follows: first, the test suite (each
test individually) is run under Miri, but with both Tree Borrows and Stacked Borrows disabled. We
call this run the “filtering run.” This run serves to eliminate tests that, for one reason or another,
cannot be tested. These include tests that use features not supported by Miri (e.g., more advanced
interaction with the host OS, inline assembly, platform-dependent features, calls to functions written
in C, etc. ), tests that simply fail due to bugs in the program they are testing,8 or those that exceed
the 60 second timeout we imposed on each execution. Also filtered are tests that cause UB already
without Tree Borrows or Stacked Borrows, due to e.g., out-of-bound accesses or use-after-frees.

Once only passing tests remain, we then run these again with Tree Borrows checking turned on,
and then a third time with Stacked Borrows. These two runs are the “comparison runs.” This then
detects code that is incompatible with Tree Borrows or Stacked Borrows or both, but would work
if there was no aliasing UB in Rust. For these runs we increased the timeout to 150 seconds, since
the added Tree Borrows and Stacked Borrows checking takes extra time.

4.3 Experimental Results
The raw results of the experiment are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen, there were 674 748 tests
in total. A bit more than half of all crates actually had a testsuite. 10 crates had to be excluded from
the analysis because their test suite did not run to completion.9

Of the 674 748 total tests, about 68% passed the filtering stage. The others were filtered, the
precise distribution of which can be seen in Figure 3a. Tests listed under Timeout ran into the
60s timeout. Those under Unsupported used a feature that Miri does not support. Those under UB

8Miri is specifically designed to trigger usually under-used codepaths around weak memory, which might explain how
some published libraries have failing tests.

triggered Undefined Behavior unrelated to Tree Borrows or Stacked Borrows (e.g., a use-after-free).
Finally, those under Failure failed due to an assertion failure or panic in the test.

Of those that passed the filtering stage, the vast majority did not trigger any issues under either
Tree Borrows or Stacked Borrows. The fact that most tests work is not too surprising, since most
libraries on crates.io are written entirely in safe code.

Answering the research questions. We now analyze the results of the two comparison runs,
which are shown in Figure 3b. There, we can see that 6568 tests failed with aliasing model violations
(“Borrow UB”) under Stacked Borrows, while 3023 tests failed under Tree Borrows. This is a
reduction by 53.97%, which is quite substantial. Looking at it in more detail, we can see that almost
all of the tests still violating Tree Borrows rules also violate Stacked Borrows. Only 31 tests that
previously passed Stacked Borrows were in violation of Tree Borrows rules. Thus, we have answers
to our research questions: More than half of the code that was previously unsupported by Stacked
Borrows is now accepted by Tree Borrows (𝑄1), while the amount of code newly broken by Tree
Borrows is extremely small (𝑄2).

Note that these numbers are biased against Tree Borrows, in the sense that parts of the Rust
ecosystem have already been using Miri for a few years and crate authors have been guided towards
writing Stacked Borrows-compliant code. Despite this bias, Tree Borrows still fares significantly
better than Stacked Borrows.

These findings are also confirmed by a recent preprint studying UB bugs in Rust FFI code [23].10

Timeouts and flaky tests. We also briefly discuss what the other cells in Figure 3b tell us. The
first, somewhat worrying trend, is that there was an order of magnitude more timeouts under Tree
Borrows than under Stacked Borrows. This is worrying because each such timeout could have
potentially been a test that had UB under Tree Borrows, but aborting the test early prevented that
UB from being observed. We suspect that this is not the case, since such tests usually consist of
a rather large loop, and experience shows that aliasing violations usually appear quickly, within
the first few iterations of the loop. Nonetheless, even if we assume that a disproportionately large
number of these timeouting tests should actually count as UB under Tree Borrows (say 15% instead
of the normal 1%), then the number of tests newly broken would still remain double-digit and
thus extremely small. Those numbers do however tell us that the performance of Miri under Tree
Borrows should be improved even more, beyond the speedups we already developed here.

Unrelated to timeouts, we observe that there were several dozen tests that passed the filtering run,
but then used unsupported features, exhibited UB unrelated to Tree Borrows or Stacked Borrows,
or failed in one of the two comparison runs. This is a bit surprising, since enabling Tree Borrows
or Stacked Borrows should not affect program behavior, aside from adding more UB. After looking
at these tests in more detail, we found out that they are so-called flaky tests, i.e., tests that rely
on non-determinism. Miri emulates non-determinism with randomness, and running such flaky
tests several times can lead to some runs succeeding, and other runs failing, depending on the
randomness. This is somewhat expected, especially since Miri contains other features that make
usually under-utilized parts of tests more common. It is also consistent with the test results, since
there seems to be no correlation between whether such an unexpected failure occurred in the Tree
Borrows or Stacked Borrows run.

A closer look at newly broken code. Finally, we closely inspected some of the tests that were
newly broken by Tree Borrows. These 31 tests are from 12 crates in total. Of those 12 crates, 4
(accounting for 7 tests) had other tests fail under Stacked Borrows as well; it was likely just a

coincidence that some tests pass despite the aliasing model violations in these crates, so we did not
inspect these crates in more detail. The remaining 8 crates (with 24 tests) break down as follows:
• moka, mini-moka, mshv-bindings, and soa-derive each had one test failure (4 total). We
developed fixes for each of them, which were all accepted by the authors. For all of them,
the reason for incompatibility was reliance on “the quirk” (see discussion in §4.1). This is
usually due to superfluous references being created for ergonomics reasons;11 these can then
be fixed by making the code slightly more verbose.

• deno_core had 12 tests fail. Here, the reason was that a struct should have been marked as
having interior mutability, but Stacked Borrows did not complain due to a tricky interaction
of both the quirk and its overly simplistic handling of two-phase borrows. We developed a
fix, which was accepted by the authors. The fix changed about 30 lines of code, and was the
most complicated fix we developed.

• bitvec accounted for one test, for which there already was a community-developed fix. It has
not yet been accepted by the crate author, and the crate seems to be abandoned in general.
• spinning accounted for one test. This failure is an instance of a flaky test caused by a race
condition. The error can also appear under Stacked Barrows, it just did not appear in the test
run due to non-determinism.

• nostd_async (6 tests) was marked as “fundamentally unsound” and deleted by the crate

author shortly after we started our test run. We did not analyze it further.

We note that our test run here tries to measure a moving target. In fact, the test run outlined
here is actually the second such run, since the first run had to be aborted and restarted after we
discovered a critical bug in Miri. Nonetheless, we already started analyzing the crates that were
found in the earlier test run. As we reported the incompatibility with Tree Borrows, one crate
author implemented our fix so quickly that the UB had already disappeared by the time we solved
our own bug in Miri and restarted the run. That crate (skl) also relied on “the quirk.” If Tree
Borrows grows to be more accepted by the Rust community in the future, we expect the number of
crates “in the wild” which are only incompatible with Tree Borrows to decrease further.

5 Proving Validity of Aliasing Optimizations
The goal of Tree Borrows is to enable optimizations around memory accesses, even in the presence
of unknown code. In this section, we give the key ideas for how to prove some of the optimizations
outlined in the earlier sections. The supplementary material for this paper contains a Rocq [29]
proof of those optimizations, based on a program logic that helps to justify a wide range of similar
transformations. Unfortunately, we do not have the space to present the program logic here. Overall,
the proof amounts to around 32 000 lines of code.

Deleting reads. In the first example below, we aim to optimize a read of a shared reference, but

the reference we use is passed to a foreign function before being read the second time:

let x : &i32 = &... // arbitrary code before
let val = *x;
f(x);
let ... = *x;
...

// arbitrary code in-between, which can also use x
// Transformation: use `val` instead
// arbitrary code afterwards

Example 17

In order to justify this transformation, we need to delete a read (of x) in the transformed program
(or target program), and prove that the read in the original program (or source program) returns the
value val. As part of this proof, we may assume absence of UB in the source program: if the source

11Rust code using raw pointers is usually more verbose than a seemingly equivalent version using references.

program has UB, then any behavior is allowed in the target program, and the proof is done. The
key proof idea is to attach an invariant to the tag in the tree corresponding to x. This invariant
says that either the tag is Disabled, or it is Frozen and the value stored at x is val. We then prove
that this invariant is maintained by all program steps, which means it must still hold after the call
to f(x). The reason it is maintained is that Frozen tags become Disabled on foreign writes, and
disallow local writes, so it is impossible to change the value while keeping the tag Frozen. Once f
returns, we check whether the tag has transitioned to Disabled. If yes, then the source program has
UB due to reading from a Disabled reference, which contradicts our earlier assumption. Therefore,
the tag must be Frozen, and thus we know that we read the expected value.

At this point, the proof seems done, but this is not yet the case: The read that we removed not
only reads from memory, it can also modify the permissions tracked in the Tree Borrows state
machines. Therefore, the tree might be in a different state in the target than it was in the source.
Specifically, a protected Reserved cousin of the tag x might be conflicted in the source, while
still being unconflicted in the target. Luckily, the remaining executions of both programs will be
identical despite this difference. In particular, if Reserved tags in the target are not conflicted, while
their source counterparts are, this can never change the behavior of a UB-free program. We can
therefore use the standard simulation relation technique to show that despite the states not being
exactly the same, the two programs still produce the same result.

Optimizing with protectors. Next, we consider Example 18 shown below, where two writes
are combined into one, across unknown code in the middle. The main difficulty here is that when g
runs, the memory between source and target differs: The source has x storing 10, but in the target,
it is 0. The only reason this works is because x is protected, and because g is not given access to a
reference or raw pointer derived from x. This ensures that g cannot observe the value stored in x.
Thus the values can diverge temporarily, without affecting g.

fn write_opt(x: &mut i32, f: impl FnOnce(), g: impl FnOnce()) {

// x is protected, since it is a function argument
f();
*x = 10;
g();
*x = 0;

// Transformation: delete write

// Transformation: write 0

Example 18

}
In our proof, this means that we can again attach an invariant to x, expressing that it is Unique,
protected, and the value stored there is 10 in the source and 0 in the target. Since foreign writes
to protected Unique tags are immediate UB, we can prove that this invariant is maintained by
arbitrary code that does not have access to x. Thus, the invariant still holds after the call to g.

Like before, we need to also prove that deleting the write in the target is admissible. Unlike
before, the main difficulty is proving that afterwards, the states are still in simulation. To account
for that, the simulation relation for protected references is quite weak, and tolerates the kinds of
differences between source and target that can be introduced by such transformations. This is
where the protector end semantics described in §3.2 becomes relevant. Since it would not be correct
to use a similarly weak simulation relation for unprotected references, the implicit accesses on
protector removal ensure that even if the states were quite different while the protector was active,
they become (almost) the same when the protector is removed, thus letting the proof pass through
(and indeed, without the implicit accesses, there is a counterexample to this optimization).

A program logic for Tree Borrows optimizations. Formally, we carry out these proofs using
Simuliris [9], a relational separation logic framework built atop Iris [13, 17] for proving fair,

Proc. ACM Program. Lang., Vol. 9, No. PLDI, Article 188. Publication date: June 2025.

188:20

termination-preserving contextual refinements of concurrent programs, which comes equipped with
built-in reasoning rules for unknown code. Simuliris has previously been used to reason about
Stacked Borrows [9, §7]; we use this as the basis for our own proof efforts. Using Simuliris, we built
a Tree Borrows Optimizations Program Logic, which in turn is able to prove that the two examples
above are correct transformations, even in the presence of concurrency.

On top of this, the program logic can be used to prove a wide range of further reorderings for
protected references. Specifically, the logic permits arbitrary insertions, deletions, and reorderings
of reads and writes, subject to three restrictions, which apply mostly to &mut references. First,
such mutable references may not be used by the arbitrary code in between the accesses we are
transforming (e.g., not be passed to g in the example above). Secondly, the activating write to a
mutable reference, which transitions it from Reserved to Unique, cannot be moved, and new writes
can only be inserted after this activating write. Lastly, once the protector ends, or once the mutable
reference is passed to unknown code, the values stored in that mutable reference must again be in
simulation, and no further insertions/deletions/reorderings are allowed. This logic is sufficiently
strong to verify the optimizations sketched in Example 1 and Example 15.

Optimizing without protectors. Although Tree Borrows permits a great deal of optimizations
involving protectors, the optimization potential for references without protectors is more limited:
without a protector, the lifetime of a reference ends at its last use, so transformations that move
the last use down are generally not permitted. Verifying these transformations for unprotected
references is made even more challenging by concurrency: such transformations are only correct
in Rust because data races are UB, which for simplicity we have not modeled in this paper (we use
a simple sequentially consistent semantics that allows racy behaviors). For the proofs above, this
was not a problem because protectors already cause enough UB without any special treatment of
data races; therefore, we did not have to reason about data races.

As a consequence, we were not able to use Simuliris to verify correctness of transformations
on unprotected references, with the exception of Example 17 above. However, some simple and
common optimizations such as read-read reordering can be verified in a sequential model of Tree
Borrows without reasoning about unknown code. Specifically, we have proven that starting in an
arbitrary state, if we execute Example 19 in its original form and in its transformed form, we end
up in the exact same state on both sides:

let x : &mut i32 = &mut ...;
let y : &mut i32 = &mut ...;
let xv = *x;
let yv = *y;
...

// Transformation: move this read down just below `let yv`

Example 19

As explained in §2.2, this crucially relies on the fact that a foreign read causes a mutable reference
to transition to Frozen, not Disabled. In contrast, Stacked Borrows does not support this reordering.

Comparison with Stacked Borrows. Tree Borrows permits slightly fewer optimizations than
Stacked Borrows. Specifically, Stacked Borrows allows inserting and reordering writes without any
regard for the activating write. This is a direct consequence of Stacked Borrows’ not having support
for two-phase borrows, and thus considering all mutable references to be immediately Unique.

In terms of which optimizations have actually been proven correct, the original Stacked Borrows
paper [12] proved that under certain conditions, a read can be hoisted up across unknown code
even for an unprotected reference. Specifically, this requires that there is already an access or retag
of the relevant reference right next to the destination that we wish to move the read to. However,
this was proven only for sequential programs. Simuliris [9] later claimed to extend this proof to

the concurrent setting; however, the formal operational semantics they use has a fatal flaw that
invalidates this result. (This was confirmed by the authors.) We are convinced that the optimization
is correct even for concurrent code in both models; however, proving this would require combining
data race reasoning with the aliasing model, which we leave to future work.

6 Related Work
The most directly related piece of work is Stacked Borrows. We have extensively compared Tree
Borrows with Stacked Borrows in §4.1. In summary, Tree Borrows loses some optimizations on
mutable references in their reservation phase, but it allows read-read reordering and permits
significantly more real-world code than Stacked Borrows.

Looking beyond Rust, we discuss prior work that studied the aliasing models of C and LLVM, as

well as low-level pointer semantics in general.

Aliasing rules for C. The C memory model [11], loosely speaking, requires that memory that
was written using a pointer of a given type is only read using pointers of the same type (with a
special exception for character types). The point of this restriction is that compilers can now be
sure that, for instance, writing to a float* pointer cannot change the result of a read through a
int* pointer. This is often referred to as type-based alias analysis (TBAA) or strict aliasing.

However, many large-scale C programs such as the Linux kernel disable type-based alias analysis
since it is incompatible with common C idioms and the only programmer-controlled way to opt
out of this mechanism (by using pointers of character type) often leads to a loss of performance. In
contrast, Tree Borrows is designed to be compatible with low-level Rust programming patterns, and
by using raw pointers programmers can opt out of the aliasing rules without any loss of efficiency.
A very strict interpretation of the strict aliasing rules has been formalized as part of the first
version of the CompCert memory model [20]; however, this model disallows the use of unions to
convert data from one type to another, even though the C standard does permit this at least under
some conditions. The conditions given for this in the standard are however quite ambiguous.12 (Later
versions of CompCert dropped the strict aliasing rules in favor of a simpler memory model [19].)
Krebbers [15] closes that gap by giving rules for union accesses that are based on how the GCC
developers interpret the standard. He shows correctness of a simple alias analysis based on this,
but does not prove correctness of any transformation.

Aside from strict aliasing, C has another source of aliasing assumptions available to the compiler:
the restrict keyword. This keyword can be used with a pointer type (as in int* restrict)
to indicate that this pointer cannot alias with any other in-scope pointer. Specifically, restrict
requires that accesses done through this pointer and pointers derived from it never overlap with
accesses done through other pointers, except when both accesses are reads. This is quite similar to
the behavior of both mutable and shared references (without interior mutability) in Rust, and we
suspect that Tree Borrows could be used as the basis for a formal definition of restrict.

Hathhorn et al. [10] give a semantics for both strict aliasing and restrict, and their framework
can be used to generate a tool that checks those semantics. However, they do not explain how their
model navigates the ambiguities of the standard, do not prove any theorems about their model, and
do not evaluate how well those semantics align with widely-used C compilers or real-world C code.
It remains an open problem to resolve the tension between C as standardized, C as implemented in
compilers, and C as written by programmers [25, 26].

12Specifically, the standard requires “that a declaration of the completed type of the union is visible”, without giving a
precise definition of “visibility”.

Aliasing rules for LLVM IR. LLVM is a project providing a low-level compiler backend and
many optimizations organized around a shared intermediate language, the LLVM IR. The IR supports
a noalias attribute on function arguments which closely matches the C restrict qualifier (in
particular, it allows aliasing of read-only accesses). LLVM is used as the main backend by the
Rust compiler, and Rust annotates function arguments of reference type with noalias, which
enables optimizations like the one in Example 12. This imposes a constraint on all proposed Rust
aliasing models: they better justify the optimizations that the compiler already performs, to avoid a
performance regression when the model is being officially adopted. Tree Borrows (like Stacked
Borrows) was designed with this in mind, so that a Rust program that complies with the rules of
Tree Borrows should translate into an LLVM IR program that satisfies all the assumptions implied by
noalias. However, while the meaning of noalias is described informally in the LLVM Language
Reference [28], it has not been formalized to our knowledge, so we cannot formally relate Tree
Borrows and noalias. Notably, while Alive2 [21] and VellVM [32, 7] formalize large parts of LLVM
IR’s semantics, they do not support noalias.

Low-level memory models. Modeling low-level pointer operations correctly has been the topic
of a lot of recent work [7, 24, 18, 14, 16, 27]. However, these models do not impose fine-grained
restrictions on how multiple pointers pointing to the same memory are allowed to alias each other.

7 Conclusion
We presented Tree Borrows, a novel aliasing model for Rust. Tree Borrows overcomes several
limitations of Stacked Borrows by accepting more real-world unsafe code, properly modeling
two-phase borrows, and supporting read-read reorderings. The core of this model is the use of a
tree to track the ancestry of each reference. In this tree, each node contains a state machine with
transitions for local and foreign memory accesses, i.e., memory accesses performed by pointers
derived from the reference this node represents and accesses performed by other pointers.

We wish to clarify that Tree Borrows is not a Borrow Checker for Rust, nor does our work
directly suggest changes to the Borrow Checker. Tree Borrows is part of the operational semantics,
while the Borrow Checker is part of the type system. That is not to say that they are completely
unrelated: as a part of type safety, it should be the case that well-typed safe programs (which
includes passing the Borrow Checker) must never cause UB (which includes passing Tree Borrows).
This has been extensively tested using Miri, but not yet been formally proven.

Future work. In future work, it would be interesting to extend our framework for proving
correctness of Tree Borrows optimizations. This framework currently has two major limitations:
(a) the activating write of a mutable reference cannot be reordered down (as in Example 12)13 and
(b) optimizations that additionally require reasoning about data races cannot be verified. Reasoning
about the interaction of data races and the tree-based aliasing model is quite complicated, so this
would likely require a complete re-design of our verification framework.

Furthermore, while one can test programs for Tree Borrows compatibility (with Miri, §4) and can
validate optimizations relying on Tree Borrows (with Simuliris in Rocq, §5), there is no framework
for proving that programs behave correctly under Tree Borrows (as Louwrink [22] does for Stacked
Borrows); this remains further work.
