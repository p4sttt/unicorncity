pass@1 lies in {0,1/3,2/3,1}, for continuous outcomes (cost,

6.1 Cross-harness comparison: SC-ON vs. OpenCode
Table IV reports the headline metrics for all three arms, and
Figure 2 positions the three arms in the resolve-vs-cost plane:
SC-ON sits upper-left of both comparators, on a cheaper iso-
$/solved curve. Across the three seeds, SC-ON resolves 50.4%
on average against OpenCode’s 45.3% (paired Wilcoxon on
per-instance pass@1, n=78, ∆=+6.0pp, p=0.087). The
directionisconsistentacrossallthreeseeds(TableIII)butdoes
not separate at the conventional threshold; the within-harness
ablation in §6.2 gives the cleanest read.
Cost. SC-ON’s $/solved sits at $2.30 mean across seeds
against OpenCode’s $2.92 (about 21% lower). Per-cell mean
cost is statistically null (paired Wilcoxon p = 0.35); the
$/solved gap is driven by SC-ON’s higher resolve rate at
comparable per-cell spend. The substantive claim is that the
structural codebase index is not more expensive to run than
agentic grep; on these benchmarks it is favorable.
Effort. SC-ON converges with fewer turns and fewer tokens.
Mean turns per cell are 28.3 for SC-ON against 36.0 for
OpenCode (paired Wilcoxon p < 0.0001); mean tokens are
10.1kagainst14.0k(alsop<0.0001);meanwall-clockfollows
at 4.5 against 5.4 minutes. The within-harness ablation in §6.2
gives the cleanest mechanism: the index shortens the agent’s

Fig. 2: Cost–resolve plane (mean of seed means; error bars
are across-seed standard deviation). The three dashed lines are
iso-$/solved reference curves (lines of constant cost per solve);
steeper means cheaper. SC-ON sits on the $2.30 curve, strictly
cheaper than SC-OFF ($2.84, within-harness) and OpenCode
($2.92, cross-harness). The headline cost claim of the paper
is the relative position of the SC-ON point, not the per-cell
mean alone.

SC-ON acc@5 averages 84.5 across seeds against OpenCode’s
75.3 (paired Wilcoxon ∆ = +8.1pp, p = 0.080); under the
legacy View A the cross-harness comparison shifts (View A
counts engine result-list paths as files the agent reached, an
asymmetry that inflates surfaced sets only for SC-ON). Full

Table V reports the within-harness ablation. The index is
the only thing that changes between the two arms; model, the
rest of the tool set, sandbox, prompts, seeds, and caps are held
